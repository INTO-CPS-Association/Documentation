Welcome to the documentation of INTO-CPS, the Integrated Tool Chain for Model-based Design of Cyber-Physical Systems.
The tools aid in modelling of complex systems allowing it to be decomposed into several smaller components. 
The complete system is simulated using a technique known as :ref:`Co-Simulation`, enabled by the use of a model exchange standard called `Functional Mock-up Interface`_ (FMI) standard.

An overview of the tools and how to use them can be found in :ref:`Tools` section.
In order to use the tools effectively it may be worthwhile to read our quick guide :ref:`fmi_intro`, rather than the full specification.
