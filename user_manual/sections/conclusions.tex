\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}
%This deliverable is the user manual for the INTO-CPS tool chain at the end of Year 3 of the \into project.
%
The tool chain supports model-based design and validation of CPSs, with an emphasis on multi-model co-simulation.

Several independent simulation tools are orchestrated by a custom co-sim\-u\-la\-tion orchestration engine, which implements both fixed and variable step size co-simulation semantics.
%
A multi-model thus co-simulated can be further verified through automated model-based testing and bounded model checking.

The tool chain benefits from a cohesive management interface, the INTO-CPS Application, the main gateway to modelling and validation with the INTO-CPS technology.
%
Following the manual should give a new user of the INTO-CPS tool chain an understanding of all the elements of the INTO-CPS vision for co-simulation.
%
This manual is accompanied by tutorial material and guidance on the main INTO-CPS tool chain website at
