  Abstract                 = {We have implemented a compiler for key parts of Modelica, an object-oriented language supporting equation-based modeling and simulation of complex physical systems. The compiler is extensible, to support experiments with emerging tools for physical models. To achieve extensibility, the implementation is done declaratively in JastAdd, a metacompilation system supporting modern attribute grammar mechanisms such as reference attributes and nonterminal attributes. This paper reports on experiences from this implementation. For name and type analyses, we illustrate how declarative design strategies, originally developed for a Java compiler, could be reused to support Modelica’s advanced features of multiple inheritance and structural subtyping. Furthermore, we present new general design strategies for declarative generation of target \{ASTs\} from source ASTs. We illustrate how these strategies are used to resolve a generics-like feature of Modelica called modifications, and to support flattening, a fundamental part of Modelica compilation. To validate that the approach is practical, we have compared the execution speed of our compiler to two existing Modelica compilers.},

  Abstract                 = { Hybrid system modelers have become a corner stone of complex embedded system development. Embedded systems include not only control components and software, but also physical devices. In this area, Simulink is a de facto standard design framework, and Modelica a new player. However, such tools raise several issues related to the lack of reproducibility of simulations (sensitivity to simulation parameters and to the choice of a simulation engine). In this paper we propose using techniques from \emph{non-standard analysis} to define a semantic domain for hybrid systems. Non-standard analysis is an extension of classical analysis in which infinitesimal (the $\varepsilon$ and $\eta$ in the celebrated generic sentence $\forall\varepsilon\exists\eta\dots$ of college maths) can be manipulated as first class citizens. This approach allows us to define both a denotational semantics, a constructive semantics, and a Kahn Process Network semantics for hybrid systems, thus establishing simulation engines on a sound but flexible mathematical foundation. These semantics offer a clear distinction between the concerns of the numerical analyst (solving differential equations) and those of the computer scientist (generating execution schemes). We also discuss a number of practical and fundamental issues in hybrid system modelers that give rise to non reproducibility of results, nondeterminism, and undesirable side effects. Of particular importance are cascaded mode changes (also called ``zero-crossings'' in the context of hybrid systems modelers).},

A specification of a hybrid system for this purpose can be viewed as a program in a domain-specific programming language. We describe the semantics of HyVisual, which is such a domain-specific programming language. The semantic properties of such a language affect our ability to understand, execute, and analyze a model. We discuss several semantic issues that come in defining such a programming language, such as the interpretation of discontinuities in continuous-time signals, and the interpretation of discrete-event signals in hybrid systems, and the consequences of numerical ODE solver techniques. We describe the solution in HyVisual by giving its operational semantics.},

The consequences of this view are discussed and demonstrated at hand of a new method to model ideal switching elements such as ideal diodes, ideal thyristors or friction. At event instants this leads to mixed continuous/discrete systems of equations that have to be solved by appropriate algorithms},
