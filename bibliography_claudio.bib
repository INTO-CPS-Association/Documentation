  abstract = {The crucial point in Model Driven Architecture (MDA) is that software and system development are based on abstract models that are successively transformed into more specific models, ideally resulting in the desired system. To this end, developers must be enabled to model different aspects like structure, behavior, consistency constraints of the system. This results in a variety of related models, which in turn need tool support on the metalevel. However, there is a lack of tools offering uniform support for metamodel definition, analysis, transformation, and integration. In this paper we present the metamodeling framework MOFLON that addresses these issues by bringing together the latest OMG standards with graph transformations and their formal semantics. MOFLON provides a combination of visual and textual notations and offers powerful modularization concepts. Using MOFLON, developers can generate code for specific tools needed to perform the desired modeling tasks.},

The authors analyze the underlying motivation for MDD and then derive a concrete set of requirements that a supporting infrastructure should satisfy. They discuss why the traditional "language definition" interpretation of metamodeling isn't a sufficient foundation and explain how it can be extended to unlock MDD's full potential.},

  abstract = {Co-simulation is a prominent method to solve multi-physics problems. Multi-physics simulations using a co-simulation approach have an intrinsic advantage. They allow well-established and specialized simulation tools for different fields and signals to be combined and reused with minor adaptations in contrast to the monolithic approach. However, the partitioned treatment of the coupled system poses the drawback of stability and accuracy challenges. If several different subsystems are used to form the co-simulation scenario, these issues are especially important. In this work, we propose a new co-simulation algorithm based on interface Jacobians. It allows for the stable and accurate solution of complex co-simulation scenarios involving several different subsystems. Furthermore, the Interface Jacobian-based Co-Simulation Algorithm is formulated such that it enables parallel execution of the participating subsystems. This results in a high-efficient procedure. Furthermore, the Interface Jacobian-based Co-Simulation Algorithm handles algebraic loops as the co-simulation scenario is defined in residual form.

The algorithm is improved here to reduce its spatial complexity and to achieve a better performance on large graphs; its features are analyzed in detail with special reference to time and memory requirements. The results of a testing performed on a publicly available database of synthetically generated graphs and on graphs relative to a real application dealing with technical drawings are presented, confirming the effectiveness of the approach, especially when working with large graphs.},

  abstract = {We present a broad extension of the conventional formalism of state machines and state diagrams, that is relevant to the specification and design of complex discrete-event systems, such as multi-computer real-time systems, communication protocols and digital control units. Our diagrams, which we call statecharts, extend conventional state-transition diagrams with essentially three elements, dealing, respectively, with the notions of hierarchy, concurrency and communication. These transform the language of state diagrams into a highly structured and economical description language. Statecharts are thus compact and expressive\textemdash{}small diagrams can express complex behavior\textemdash{}as well as compositional and modular. When coupled with the capabilities of computerized graphics, statecharts enable viewing the description at different levels of detail, and make even very large specifications manageable and comprehensible. In fact, we intend to demonstrate here that statecharts counter many of the objections raised against conventional state diagrams, and thus appear to render specification by diagrams an attractive and plausible approach. Statecharts can be used either as a stand-alone behavioral description or as part of a more general design methodology that deals also with the system's other aspects, such as functional decomposition and data-flow specification. We also discuss some practical experience that was gained over the last three years in applying the statechart formalism to the specification of a particularly complex system.},

  abstract = {Space support in databases poses new challenges in every part of a database management system \& the capability of spatial support in the physical layer is considered very important. This has led to the design of spatial access methods to enable the effective \& efficient management of spatial objects. R-trees have a simplicity of structure \& together with their resemblance to the B-tree, allow developers to incorporate them easily into existing database management systems for the support of spatial query processing. This book provides an extensive survey of the R-tree evolution, studying the applicability of the structure \& its variations to efficient query processing, accurate proposed cost models, \& implementation issues like concurrency control and parallelism. Written for database researchers, designers \& programmers as well as graduate students, this comprehensive monograph will be a welcome addition to the field.},

  abstract = {High-level synthesis is highly demanded for managing the complexity of analog and mixed-signal system designs. However, synthesis methods are currently in their infancy. The absence of a high-level specification notation is an important limitation for the development of efficient synthesis methods. This paper presents a behavioral model and a VHDL-AMS subset for high-level synthesis of analog and mixed-signal systems. The model (named aBlox) offers a composition semantics for functionality description and an orthogonal declarative mechanism for expressing the performance requirements of a system. The model was developed after analyzing a large number of systems for telecommunication, signal processing, control engineering, and analog computing. The model expresses the meaning of: 1) analog and digital data; 2) continuous and event-driven functionality (behavior); 3) analog performance attributes; and 4) analog-digital interactions. The aBlox model serves as a foundation for defining a semantically sound VHDL-AMS subset for synthesis. Also, the VHDL-AMS subset is identified so that its constructs can be mapped to architectures of circuits. We introduce several restrictions to the VHDL-AMS instructions, such that their semantics match that of the aBlox model. To motivate the usefulness of the model and the VHDL-AMS subset, we present a case study that uses VHDL-AMS inputs.},

  title = {Cyber-Physical Systems Software Development: Way of Working and Tool Suite},
  abstract = {Designing embedded control software for modern cyber-physical systems becomes more and more difficult, because of the increasing amount and complexity of their requirements. The regular requirements are extended with modern requirements, for example, to get a general purpose cyber-physical system capable of fulfilling a variety of different, ad-hoc tasks or to be suitable in environments with lots of human interactions. A typical example of modern cyber-physical systems, which have these modern requirements, are medical robotic systems used in surgeries. The essential goal of this research is to provide a way of working for the design of the control software for cyber-physical systems, and thereby providing a solution of the problem of the increasing complexity of the control software due to the modern requirements described above. The way of working makes use of model-driven design (MDD) techniques to reduce the complexity of the control software design. Additional objectives are to provide a component blue-print, an execution framework and tooling support, all to further decrease the complexity of the designs and to increase the usability of the provided way of working. In the end, it is concluded that the proposed way of working provides design steps for the complete design trajectory, starting at the initial designs up-to and including the deployment of the control software on the target system. It is also concluded that the supporting component blue-print (called Generic Architecture Component, or GAC) tightly matches the way of working and increases its value and usability. The execution framework (called LUNA Universal Network Architecture, or LUNA) and the tool-suite (called Twente Embedded Real-time Robotic Application, or TERRA) further increase the usability of the way of working by adding graphical model-driven design support to the way of working, with e.g. model validation and code generation. This all increases the understanding of the complex models and thus decreasing the complexity of the control software design. It is recommended to further evaluate the way of working, by using it to implement different control applications to steer all kinds of different cyber-physical systems. Furthermore it is recommended to add simulation capabilities and model management to the TERRA tool suite to increase its usability further.},

The global validation of these systems requires new techniques offering high abstraction levels and simulation accuracy from a time point of view. The main challenge is the time synchronization and the accommodation of different concepts specific to continuous and discrete models. This paper proposes a co-simulation approach that relies on Simulink for the continuous simulation and SystemC for the discrete simulation. It is based on more than one synchronization model. The synchronization and the communication are assured by co-simulation interfaces. The article also introduces the CODIS tool for the automatic generation of co-simulation instances composed of models and co-simulation interfaces.

  doi = {10.1109/MSCPES.2013.6623316},
  abstract = {The success and the advantages of model-based design approaches for complex cyber-physical systems have led to the development of the FMI (Functional Mock-Up Interface), an open interface specification that allows to share dynamic system models between different simulation environments. The FMI specification intentionally provides only the most essential and fundamental functionalities in the form of a C interface. On the one hand, this increases flexibility in use and portability to virtually any platform (even embedded control systems). On the other hand, such a low-level approach implies several prerequisites a simulation tool has to fulfil in order to be able to utilize such an FMI component, for instance the availability of adequate numerical integrators. The FMI++ library presented here addresses this problem for models according to the FMI for Model Exchange by providing high-level functionalities, especially suitable for but not limited to discrete event simulation tools. The capabilities of this approach are illustrated with the help of several applications, where the FMI++ library has been successfully deployed. This approach intends to bridge the gap between the basic FMI specifications and the typical requirements of simulation tools that do not primarily focus on continuous time-based simulation. In other words, this enables such models to be used as de-facto stand-alone co-simulation components.},

  abstract = {As SystemC gains popularity as a modeling language of choice for system-on-chip (SoC) designs, heterogeneous modeling in SystemC and efficient simulation become increasingly important. However, in the current reference implementation, all SystemC models are simulated through a nondeterministic discrete-event (DE) simulation kernel that schedules events at run time mimicking other models of computation (MoCs) using DE, which may get cumbersome. This sometimes results in too many delta cycles hindering the simulation performance of the model. SystemC also uses this simulation kernel as the target simulation engine. This makes it difficult to express different MoCs naturally in SystemC. In an SoC model, different components may need to be naturally expressible in different MoCs. These components may be amenable to static scheduling-based simulation or other presimulation optimization techniques. The goal is to create a simulation framework for heterogeneous SystemC models and to gain efficiency and ease of use within the framework of SystemC reference implementation. In this paper, a synchronous data flow (SDF) kernel extension for SystemC is introduced. Experimental results showing improvement in simulation time are also presented.},

However, their design is currently confronted to important challenges. One of the key challenges is the integration of pre-built components specific to different application domains (e.g. electrical, mechanical, optical, etc.). In this context, new \{CAD\} tools are mandatory to offer a global view of the designed systems and to enable their overall validation. This paper presents a generic discrete\textendash{}continuous simulation model for an accurate global validation in heterogeneous systems design. This model enables to use powerful tools for the discrete and continuous domains. Solutions are proposed for model's layers implementation in the case of SystemC and Simulink simulators. The continuous\textendash{}discrete simulation tool is proposed. This tool integrates the two previous simulators by automatically generating global simulation model instances. The evaluation of the simulation model was performed using an illustrative application.},

  abstract = {Modelling and simulation are becoming increasingly important enablers for the analysis and design of complex systems. In application domains such as automotive design, the notion of a "virtual experiment" is taken to the limit and complex designs are model-checked, simulated, and optimized extensively before a single realization is ever made. This "doing it right the first time" leads to tremendous cost savings and improved quality. Furthermore, with appropriate models, it is often possible to automatically synthesize (parts of) the system-to-be-built. In this paper, the basic concepts of modelling and simulation are introduced. These concepts are based on general systems theory and start from the idea of a model as an abstract representation of knowledge about structure and behaviour of some system. The purpose is either analysis or design in a particular experimental context. Typically, different formalisms are used such as Ordinary Differential Equations, Queueing Networks, and State Automata. It will be shown how these different formalisms all share a common structure and differ in the choice of time base, state space, and description of temporal evolution. This allows one to classify formalisms on the one hand and to find a common ground for implementing simulators on the other hand.},

In this paper, we advocate collaborative modelling and co-simulation to verify different aspects of the system as a whole before implementation. This paper proposes a development approach and structuring mechanism for CT-intensive ECS designs using co-modelling and co-simulation techniques. Based on this approach, an integrated co-model can be developed and refined using different domain-specific languages and tools. Influences from one domain to the other can be simulated via co-simulation and analysed in both perspectives. Our structuring and development process has been applied to a mobile robot using this co-simulation technique. We have experienced that structuring the co-modelling process allows us to produce co-models an co-simulations effectively. Future work is on checking for model inconsistencies during collaboration, and provide approaches to deal with this.},

For example, two S-MoC domains that are not connected can have different durations of their evaluation cycles. When connecting them, the relation between their respective time structures has to be defined. This relation can be constant and simple, or it can vary dynamically. The interface processes between the MoC domains define this relation. This chapter defines interface processes between different MoC types. It distinguishes between interfaces that add timing information and those that remove timing information. In general, both can be done in many different ways, but only one possible solution is described. Based on these interface processes, this chapter introduces an integrated MoC\textemdash{}consisting of different MoC domains and interface processes. Several profound issues emerge when connecting MoC domains, which go beyond the technical insertion and suppression of time information. This chapter proposes distinguishing between the time structures of different MoC domains and their relations to each other, the protocol used to model communication between different domains, and the modeling of delays on the channels between different domains.},

  abstract = {Model transformations are increasingly being incorporated in software development processes. However, as systems being developed with transformations grow in size and complexity, the performance of the transformations tends to degrade. In this paper we investigate the factors that have an impact on the execution performance of model transformations. We analyze the performance of three model transformation language engines, namely ATL, QVT Operational Mappings and QVT Relations. We implemented solutions to two transformation problems in these languages and compared the performance of these transformations. We extracted metric values from the transformations to systematically analyze how their characteristics influence transformation execution performance. We also implemented a solution to a transformation problem in ATL in three functionally equivalent ways, but with different language constructs to evaluate the effect of language constructs on transformation performance. The results of this paper enable a transformation designer to estimate beforehand the performance of a transformation, and to choose among implementation alternatives to achieve the best performance. In addition, transformation engine developers may find some of our results useful in order to tune their tools for better performance.},

  issn = {00010782},
  doi = {10.1145/84537.84545},
  abstract = {Parallel discrete event simulation (PDES), sometimes called distributed simulation, refers to the execution of a single discrete event simulation program on a parallel computer. PDES has attracted a considerable amount of interest in recent years. From a pragmatic standpoint, this interest arises from the fact that large simulations in engineering, computer science, economics, and military applications, to mention a few, consume enormous amounts of time on sequential machines. From an academic point of view, parallel simulation is interesting because it represents a problem domain that often contains substantial amounts of parallelism (e.g., see [59]), yet paradoxically, is surprisingly difficult to parallelize in practice. A sufficiently general solution to the PDES problem may lead to new insights in parallel computation as a whole. Historically, the irregular, data-dependent nature of PDES programs has identified it as an application where vectorization techniques using supercomputer hardware provide little benefit [14].A discrete event simulation model assumes the system being simulated only changes state at discrete points in simulated time. The simulation model jumps from one state to another upon the occurrence of an event. For example, a simulator of a store-and-forward communication network might include state variables to indicate the length of message queues, the status of communication links (busy or idle), etc. Typical events might include arrival of a message at some node in the network, forwarding a message to another network node, component failures, etc.We are especially concerned with the simulation of asynchronous systems where events are not synchronized by a global clock, but rather, occur at irregular time intervals. For these systems, few simulator events occur at any single point in simulated time; therefore parallelization techniques based on lock-step execution using a global simulation clock perform poorly or require assumptions in the timing model that may compromise the fidelity of the simulation. Concurrent execution of events at different points in simulated time is required, but as we shall soon see, this introduces interesting synchronization problems that are at the heart of the PDES problem.This article deals with the execution of a simulation program on a parallel computer by decomposing the simulation application into a set of concurrently executing processes. For completeness, we conclude this section by mentioning other approaches to exploiting parallelism in simulation problems.Comfort and Shepard et al. have proposed using dedicated functional units to implement specific sequential simulation functions, (e.g., event list manipulation and random number generation [20, 23, 47]). This method can provide only a limited amount of speedup, however. Zhang, Zeigler, and Concepcion use the hierarchical decomposition of the simulation model to allow an event consisting of several subevents to be processed concurrently [21, 98]. A third alternative is to execute independent, sequential simulation programs on different processors [11, 39]. This replicated trials approach is useful if the simulation is largely stochastic and one is performing long simulation runs to reduce variance, or if one is attempting to simulate a specific simulation problem across a large number of different parameter settings. However, one drawback with this approach is that each processor must contain sufficient memory to hold the entire simulation. Furthermore, this approach is less suitable in a design environment where results of one experiment are used to determine the experiment that should be performed next because one must wait for a sequential execution to be completed before results are obtained.},

Automotive control system is a typical CPS example and often designed based on a time-triggered paradigm. In this paper, a co-simulation framework that considers interacting CPS components for assisting time-triggered automotive CPS design is proposed. Virtual prototyping of automotive vehicles is the core of this framework, which uses SystemC to model the cyber components and integrates CarSim to model the vehicle dynamics. A network/platform model in SystemC forms the backbone of the virtual prototyping. The network/platform model consists of processing elements abstracted by real-time operating systems, communication systems, sensors, and actuators. The framework is also integrated with a model-based design tool to enable rapid prototyping. The framework is validated by comparing simulation results with the results from a hardware-in-the-loop automotive simulator. The framework is also used for design space exploration (DSE). ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.conengprac.2011.04.013},
  abstract = {Computation has quickly become of paramount importance in the design of engineered systems, both to support their features as well as their design. Tool support for high-level modeling formalisms has endowed design specifications with executable semantics. Such specifications typically include not only discrete-time and discrete-event behavior, but also continuous-time behavior that is stiff from a numerical integration perspective. The resulting stiff hybrid dynamic systems necessitate variable-step solvers to simulate the continuous-time behavior as well as solver algorithms for the simulation of discrete-time and discrete-event behavior. The combined solvers rely on complex computer code which makes it difficult to directly solve design tasks with the executable specifications. To further leverage the executable specifications in design, this work aims to formalize the semantics of stiff hybrid dynamic systems at a declarative level by removing implementation detail and only retaining 'what' the computer code does and not 'how' it does it. A stream-based approach is adopted to formalize variable-step solver semantics and to establish a computational model of time that supports discrete-time and discrete-event behavior. The corresponding declarative formalization is amenable to computational methods and it is shown how model checking can automatically generate, or synthesize, a feedforward control strategy for a stiff hybrid dynamic system. Specifically, a stamper in a surface mount device is controlled to maintain a low acceleration of the stamped component for a prescribed minimum duration of time. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Using compiler techniques, we describe an approach to automatically generate reversible computations, and to optimize them to transparently reap the performance benefits of reverse computation. For certain fine-grain models, such as queuing network models, we show that reverse computation can yield significant improvement in execution speed coupled with significant reduction in memory utilization, as compared to traditional state-saving. On sample models using reverse computation, we observe as much as three-fold improvement in execution speed over traditional state-saving},

  abstract = {Discrete Event Specification (DEVS) formalism has been used to study dynamics of discrete event systems. DEVS environments are typically open architectures that have been extended to execute on various middleware such as CORBA, Grid computing, P2P networks, RMI and others. The present work aims to provide another development environment using the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) framework. The proposed DEVS Modeling Language (DEVSML) is built on XML and provides model interoperability among DEVS models located at remote locations. The DEVSML environment is built on client-sever paradigm and the simulation is executed at the server's end. The proposed DEVS atomic and coupled DTDs are open to standardization from the community for successful model sharing and collaboration. The DEVSML framework provides the needed feature of run-time composability of coupled systems using the SOA framework. DEVSML also provides the capability to translate model to and from XML and JAVA programming language leading to model composability and validation. This paper will demonstrate the client application as well as the server architecture underlying the DEVSML framework. 1.},

  abstract = {Models of computation (MoC) are reviewed and organised with respect to the time abstraction they use. Continuous time, discrete time, synchronous and untimed MoCs are distinguished. System level models serve a variety of objectives with partially contradicting requirements. Consequently, it is argued that different MoCs are necessary for the various tasks and phases in the design of an embedded system. Moreover, different MoCs have to be integrated to provide a coherent system modelling and analysis environment. The relation between some popular languages and the reviewed MoCs is discussed to find that a given MoC is offered by many languages and a single language can support multiple MoCs. It is contended that it is of importance for the quality of tools and overall design productivity, which abstraction levels and which primitive operators are provided in a language. However, it is observed that there are various flexible ways to do this, e.g. by way of heterogeneous frameworks, coordination languages and embedding of different MoCs in the same language.},

Two applications, regardless of operating system, programming language, or any other technical implementation detail, communicate using XML messages over open Internet protocols such as HTTP or SMTP. The Simple Open Access Protocol (SOAP) is a specification that details how to encode that information and has become the messaging protocol of choice for Web services. "Programming Web Services with SOAP" is a detailed guide to using SOAP and other leading web services standards-WSDL (Web Service Description Language), and UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration protocol). You'll learn the concepts of the web services architecture and get practical advice on building and deploying web services in the enterprise. This authoritative book decodes the standards, explaining the concepts and implementation in a clear, concise style. You'll also learn about the major toolkits for building and deploying web services. Examples in Java, Perl, C, and Visual Basic illustrate the principles. Significant applications developed using Java and Perl on the Apache Tomcat web platform address real issues such as security, debugging, and interoperability.

In order for MDA to reach its full potential, the ability to manipulate and transform models most obviously from the Platform Independent Model (PIM) to the Platform Specic Models (PSM) is vital. Recognizing this need, the OMG issued a Request For Proposals (RFP) largely concerned with nding a suitable mechanism for trans- forming models. This paper outlines the relevant background material, summarizes the approach taken by the QVT-Partners (to whom the authors belong), presents a non-trivial example using the QVT-Partners approach, and finally sketches out what the future holds for model transformations.},

Are you frustrated with demanding languages that seem to get in your way, instead of getting the work done? If so, then weve got a language and book for you! Ruby is a fully object-oriented language, much like the classic object-oriented language, Smalltalk. Like Smalltalk, it is dynamically typed (as opposed to Java or C++), but unlike Smalltalk, Ruby features the same conveniences found in modern scripting languages such as Perl and Python. The combination of the power of a pure object-oriented language with the convenience of a scripting language makes Ruby a favorite tool of intelligent, forward-thinking programmers. The Pickaxe contains four major sections: An acclaimed tutorial on using Ruby. The definitive reference to the language. Complete documentation of all built-in classes, modules, and methods. Complete descriptions of all 98 standard libraries. Readers of the First Edition will appreciate the new and expanded content, including: enhanced coverage of installation, packaging, documenting Ruby source code, threading and synchronization, and enhancing Rubys capabilities using C-language extensions. Programming for the world-wide web is easy in Ruby with new chapters on XML/RPC, SOAP, distributed ruby, templating systems and other web services. Theres even a new chapter on unit testing. This is the definitive reference manual for Ruby, including a description of all the standard library modules, a complete reference to all built-in classes and modules (including more than 250 significant changes since the First Edition). Coverage of other features has grown tremendously, including details on how to harness the sophisticated capabilities of irb, so programmers can dynamically examine and experiment with running code. The definitive reference manual for Ruby programmers. Up-to-date and expanded for Ruby version 1.8. Complete documentation of all built-in classes, modules, and methods. Complete descriptions of all 98 standard libraries. 200+ pages of new content in this edition. NEW: Learn more about Rubys web tools, unit testing, and programming philosophy.},

  doi = {10.1145/1066157.1066239},
  abstract = {In this paper, we propose new graph-based data structure and indexing to organize and retrieve video data. Several researches have shown that a graph can be a better candidate for modeling semantically rich and complicated multimedia data. However, there are few methods that consider the temporal feature of video data, which is a distinguishable and representative characteristic when compared with other multimedia (i.e., images). In order to consider the temporal feature effectively and efficiently, we propose a new graph-based data structure called Spatio-Temporal Region Graph (STRG). Unlike existing graph-based data structures which provide only spatial features, the proposed STRG further provides temporal features, which represent temporal relationships among spatial objects. The STRG is decomposed into its subgraphs in which redundant subgraphs are eliminated to reduce the index size and search time, because the computational complexity of graph matching (subgraph isomorphism) is NP-complete. In addition, a new distance measure, called Extended Graph Edit Distance (EGED), is introduced in both non-metric and metric spaces for matching and indexing respectively. Based on STRG and EGED, we propose a new indexing method STRG-Index, which is faster and more accurate since it uses tree structure and clustering algorithm. We compare the STRG-Index with the M-tree, which is a popular tree-based indexing method for multimedia data. The STRG-Index outperforms the M-tree for various query loads in terms of cost and speed.},

  doi = {10.1109/ICSE.2005.1553582},
  abstract = {Model-based testing has become increasingly popular in recent years. Major reasons include: (1) the need for quality assurance for increasingly complex systems, (2) the emerging model-centric development paradigm, e.g., UML and MDA, with its seemingly direct connection to testing, and (3) the advent of test-centered development methodologies. Model-based testing relies on execution traces of behavior models. They are used as test cases for an implementation: input and expected output. This complements the ideas of model-driven testing. The latter uses static models to derive test drivers to automate test execution. This assumes the existence of test cases, and is, like the particular intricacies of OO testing, not in the focus of this tutorial. We cover major methodological and technological issues: the business case of model-based testing within model-based development, the need for abstraction and inverse concretization, test selection, and test case generation. We (1) discuss different scenarios of model-based testing, (2) present common abstractions when building models, and their consequences for testing, (3) explain how to use functional, structural, and stochastic test selection criteria, and (4) describe today's test generation technology. We provide both practical guidance and a discussion of the state-of-the-art. Potentials of model-based testing in practical applications and future research are highlighted.},

The article describes the processes by which demand for elite sport healthcare has increased in the UK. It further charts the subsequent response within medicine and physiotherapy and, in particular, the institutionalisation of sport-specific sub-disciplines through the introduction of specialist qualifications. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with 14 doctors and 14 physiotherapists, the article argues that organisational changes have led to intra-professional tensions within both professional groups but in qualitatively different forms reflecting the organisational traditions and professional identities of the respective disciplines. Organisational changes promoting multi-disciplinary healthcare teams have also fostered an environment conducive to high levels of inter-professional cooperation though significant elements of inter-professional conflict remain. This study illustrates how intra-professional relations are affected by specialisation, how legitimation discourses are used by different professions, and how intra- and inter-professional conflict and cooperation should be seen as highly interdependent processes.},

A city guide web site can use maps to show the location of restaurants, museums, and art venues. A business can post a map for reaching its offices. The state government can present a map showing average income by area.  Developers who want to publish maps on the web often discover that commercial tools cost too much and hunting down the free tools scattered across Internet can use up too much of your time and resources. "Web Mapping Illustrated" shows you how to create maps, even interactive maps, with free tools, including MapServer, OpenEV, GDAL/OGR, and PostGIS. It also explains how to find, collect, understand, use, and share mapping data, both over the traditional Web and using OGistandard services like WFS and WMS.  Mapping is a growing field that goes beyond collecting and analyzing GIS data. "Web Mapping Illustrated" shows how to combine free geographic data, GPS, and data management tools into one resource for your mapping information needs so you don't have to lose your way while searching for it.  Remember the fun you had exploring the world with maps? Experience the fun again with "Web Mapping Illustrated." This book will take you on a direct route to creating valuable maps.},

  doi = {10.1007/3-540-28554-7_9},
  abstract = {Refactoring is an essential approach toward improving the internal structure of a software system while preserving its external behavior. Traditional refactoring techniques have focused on the implementation stage, with source code as the primary artifact of the refactoring process. However, a recent trend is to apply the concepts of refactoring to higher levels of abstraction. Consequently, model refactoring is emerging as a desirable means to improve design models using behavior-preserving transformations. This chapter describes a practical approach toward implementing model-level refactoring. A model transformation engine has been developed and provides a generalized underlying refactoring tool for manipulating models. A model refactoring browser is integrated within the model transformation engine to enable the automation and customization of various refactoring methods for either generic models or domain-specific models. A result of this work is the capability to perform model refactoring rapidly using user-specified transformation rules.},

Similarly, the use of domain-specific languages also necessitates transformations that map domain-specific constructs into the constructs of an underlying programming language. Thus, in these cases, the writing of transformation tools becomes a first-class activity of the software engineer. This paper introduces a language that was designed to support implementing highly efficient transformation programs that perform model-to-model or model-to-code translations. The language uses the concepts of graph transformations and metamodeling, and is supported by a suite of tools that allow the rapid prototyping and realization of transformation tools.},

In this work a heuristically optimizing approach to subgraph matching on labeled graphs is described. It relies on the fact that the runtime of the matching process can vary significantly for different matching strategies. The finding of a good matching strategy is stated as an optimization problem which is solved heuristically. The cost model for the possible matching strategies takes the structure of the present host graph into account. The necessary information can be obtained by an analysis of the host graph.},

The first problem is addressed by languages supporting user-definable rewriting strategies. The second problem is addressed by the extension of rewriting strategies with scoped dynamic rewrite rules. Dynamic rules are defined at run-time and can access variables available from their definition context. Rules defined within a rule scope are automatically retracted at the end of that scope. In this paper, we explore the design space of dynamic rules, and their application to transformation problems. The technique is formally defined by extending the operational semantics underlying the program transformation language Stratego, and illustrated by means of several program transformations in Stratego, including constant propagation, bound variable renaming, dead code elimination, function inlining, and function specialization.},

At the core of business-driven development are business processes, which are usually modeled by combining graphical and textual notations. During the business-driven development process, business-process models are taken down to the IT level, where they describe the so-called choreography of services in a Service-Oriented Architecture. The derivation of a service choreography based on a business-process model is simple and straightforward for toy examples only-for realistic applications, many challenges at the methodological and technical level have to be solved.

  abstract = {This book tells a story. The story concerns the concepts, ideas, methods, and results fundamental to computer science. It is not specifically about computer technology, nor is it about computer programming, though obviously it is heavily influenced by both. The book is intended to fill a rather disturbing gap in the literature related to the computer revolution. Scores of excellent books can be found on computers themselves, with details of their structure, workings, and operation. There are also numerous books about the act of writing programs for computers in any of a growing number of languages. These books come at a wide range of levels, some aimed at people with no computer-related background at all, and some aimed at the most computer-literate professionals. In addition, there are many books on subjects pe- ripheral to the technology, such as the social and legal aspects of the revolution, as well as books describing the relevance of computers to a variety of application areas. All this comes as no surprise. People are curious about computers, and want to learn how to put them to use. They are typically interested in specific kinds of computers, and often for specific purposes, too.},

Our approach is exemplified using Viatra2.},

Six hundred and forty ticks (447 nymphs and 193 adults) collected throughout Portugal were analyzed using two nested-PCR protocols, one targeting the fla flagellin[m1] gene, and the other the internal transcribed space region between the 5S and the 23S rRNA. As a result, Borrelia miyamotoi was detected, for the first time, in one I. ricinus nymph collected in the Lisboa district. In addition, a prevalence of 11\% (71/640) for B. burgdorferi sensu lato was obtained. Despite no human relapsing fever cases due to B. miyamotoi have been reported yet in Portugal, surveillance must be improved, to get a better insight into the prevalence and distribution of this spirochete in ticks.},

Several important engineering tasks supported by model-based tools \textendash{} such as well-formedness constraint validation or model transformations \textendash{} rely on efficiently evaluating model queries. If the models change rapidly or frequently, it is beneficial to provide live and incrementally evaluated queries that automatically propagate model changes to keep query results consistent. The current paper reports on the of EMF-IncQuery framework focusing on new features of its integrated development environment (such as query validation and visualization) and its support for integrating queries to existing applications (e.g. by auto-generated data bindings) built on top of the industry standard Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF). Our approach is illustrated on a case study integrating well-formedness constraints to the Papyrus \{UML\} tool by live model queries of EMF-IncQuery with negligible additional manual programming effort.},

The Starburst project at IBM's Almaden Research Center aims to extend relational DBMS technology to bridge this gap between applications and the DBMS. While providing a full function relational system to enable sharing across applications, Starburst will also allow (sophisticated) programmers to add many kinds of extensions to the base system's capabilities, including language extensions (e.g., new datatypes and operations), data management extensions (e.g., new access and storage methods) and internal processing extensions (e.g., new join methods and new query transformations). To support these features, the database query language processor must be very powerful and highly extensible. Starburst's language processor features a powerful query language, rule-based optimization and query rewrite, and an execution system based on an extended relational algebra. In this paper, we describe the design of Starburst's query language processor and discuss the ways in which the language processor can be extended to achieve Starburst's goals.},

In choosing among the various histograms, one has to balance between two conflicting goals: optimality, so that generated estimates have the least error, and practicality, so that histograms can be constructed and maintained efficiently. In this paper, we present both theoretical and experimental results on several issues related to this trade-off. Our overall conclusion is that the most effective approach is to focus on the class of histograms that accurately maintain the frequencies of a few attribute values and assume the uniform distribution for the rest, and choose for each relation the histogram in that class that is optimal for a self-join query.},

Hybrid bond graphs introduce an ideal switching element, the controlled junction, to approximate continuous behaviour that is too complex for numerical analysis (e.g. because of non-linearities or steep gradients). HYBRSIM is a tool for hybrid bond graph modelling and simulation implemented in Java and is documented in this paper. It performs event detection and location based on a bisectional search, handles run-time causality changes, including derivative causality, performs physically consistent (re-)initialization and supports two types of event iteration because of dynamic coupling. It exports hybrid bond graph models in Java and C/C++ code that includes discontinuities as switched equations (i.e. pre-enumeration is not required).},

For instance, for hydraulic check valves or electrical transistors it is often convenient to consider them as switches. On the other hand, there is still an ongoing discussion on how to represent the abstraction of discontinuities most suitably in a bond graph framework. In this paper an approach proposed in (W. Borutzky, J. Broenink and K. C. Wijbrans, ``Graphical Description of Physical System Models Containing Discontinuities'', Proc. 1993 European Simulation Multiconference, Lyon, France, 7\textendash{}9 June 1993, pp. 203\textendash{}207) is used for developing a model of a particular example of a real-world hydraulic-mechanical system in which check valves of a rectifier bridge and the limitation of spool displacement in a control valve give rise to consider a partly discontinuous description, while the rest of the model is continuous. The system is represented both by means of a small Petri net and a set of three bond graph models each corresponding to a major mode of operation. For validation the model was coded manually in ACSL. Some simulation results are included.},

  abstract = {We propose timed (finite) automata to model the behavior of real-time systems over time. Our definition provides a simple, and yet powerful, way to annotate state-transition graphs with timing constraints using finitely many real-valued clocks. A timed automaton accepts timed words\textendash{}infinite sequences in which a real-valued time of occurrence is associated with each symbol. We study timed automata from the perspective of formal language theory: we consider closure properties, decision problems, and subclasses. We consider both nondeterministic and deterministic transition structures, and both B\"uchi and Muller acceptance conditions. We show that nondeterministic timed automata are closed under union and intersection, but not under complementation, whereas deterministic timed Muller automata are closed under all Boolean operations. The main construction of the paper is an (PSPACE) algorithm for checking the emptiness of the language of a (nondeterministic) timed automaton. We also prove that the universality problem and the language inclusion problem are solvable only for the deterministic automata: both problems are undecidable ($\Pi$11-hard) in the nondeterministic case and PSPACE-complete in the deterministic case. Finally, we discuss the application of this theory to automatic verification of real-time requirements of finite-state systems.},

The last kind of complexity can be easily overlooked when developing components. They proceed to explain two kinds of coupling: constructive and destructive. Constructive is desired coupling. Destructive arises mostly due to intrinsic complexity and is usually unexpected/undesired. They illustrate this with a use case for a AGV material handling system. They show different problems that have shown up in this system due to destructive and constructive coupling, and how they affected certain functions of the system. They motivate the need for a tool that allows engineers to detect non-obvious interactions between physical parameters.},

As with any blueprint or schematic, a consistent language or coding system is required to ensure others can read it. This paper introduces such a design language, called a functional basis, where product function is characterized in a verb-object (function-flow) format. The set of functions and flows is intended to comprehensively describe the mechanical design space. Clear definitions are provided for each function and flow. The functional basis is compared to previous functional representations and is shown to subsume these attempts as well as offer a more consistent classification scheme. Applications to the areas of product architecture development, function structure generation, and design information archival and transmittal are discussed. [S1050-0472(00)00704-2]},

Simulation concepts are based on the abstract simulator concept for discrete event simulation developed by Zeigler. Similar simulation methods have been developed to simulate modular, hierarchical discrete time and differential equation specified systems as well as multi-formalism models. Included in the paper are several examples of multi-formalism models together with the simulation results from the STIMS environment-an implementation of the modelling and simulation concepts in Interlisp-D/LOOPS.},

  title = {Real-Time Multirate Synchronous Simulation with Single and Multiple Processors},
  volume = {3369},
  abstract = {It is well known that the efficiency of simulating large, complex dynamic systems can be significantly improved by using multi-rate integration, that is, by employing different integration frame rates for the simulation of fast and slow subsystem. Also, it is apparent that the overall speed of such simulations can be increased very significantly with the utilization of multiple processors. These considerations become especially important when the calculations must be run at real-time speed, as in hardware- in-the-loop simulations. However, there are significant issues regarding the scheduling algorithms for multi-rate integration within a single processor, as well as the data transfers between multiple processors. In this paper we show how these problems can be greatly simplified by letting each subsystem simulation run asynchronously with respect to other subsystem simulations, either using fixed or variable integration step sizes. Key to the successful implementation of both multi-rate integration and real-time, variable-step integration is the use of accurate extrapolation formulas to convert data sequences for one frame rate to another and to compensate for time mismatches and latencies in any real- time data sequences. Each processor in a multi-processor simulation can then be assigned to an identifiable subsystem or group of subsystems and run at its own frame rate, either fixed or variable. In this paper several examples of such simulations, both real time and non-real time, are presented. Utilization of the asynchronous methodology has the potential of greatly reducing the difficulties associated with interconnecting and testing many processors and hardware subsystems in a complex hardware-in-the-loop simulation.},

For complex systems, models are made of parts which use different modeling formalisms. The main issues in the simulation of such systems are the specification of the semantics of each modeling formalism, and of the interactions between heterogeneous parts of a model. ModHel'X relies on component based modeling and models of computation to address these problems and focuses on the computation of one possible behavior of a model. This includes simulation and code generation. ModHel'X defines a MOF meta-model for describing the structural elements of a modeling language. The semantics of modeling languages is expressed in an imperative style and addresses three aspects: control, data and time. ModHel'X is supported by a simulator of multi-formalism models.},

In order to manage the complexity of systems, models are decomposed into models of simpler subsystems.

Through the example of a power window system, this article presents an approach to the specification of the semantic adaptation of data, time and control between models of computation. The approach is supported by ModHel'X, a heterogeneous modeling and simulation environment. The example is simple enough to be completely described in the article, but rich enough to illustrate the matters of (a) defining models of computation, and (b) specifying the semantic adaptation between models of computation.},

  abstract = {The simulation of cyber-physical systems involves modular heterogeneous systems. When embedding continuous subsystems in a discrete event system, in a classic approach the different subsystems use the same communication points and wait for each other. The approach presented in this paper uses predictions for every single continuous subsystem. That way the continuous subsystems can be used as discrete components in a discrete event system. This concept is implemented with FMUs (Functional Mock-up Units) generated with OpenModelica and the Discrete Event domain of Ptolemy II as a proof of concept. A model is implemented using this environment and compared to another implementation that uses only Ptolemy II. The results show the better scalability and shorter runtime of the presented approach compared to the pure Ptolemy II approach.},

Using the Cantor metric, which maps timed signals, continuous or discrete, into a metric space, we define causality as contractive properties of processes operating on these signals. Thus, the Banach fixed point theorem can be applies to establish conditions for the existence, uniqueness, and liveness of the behaviors for mixed-signal and hybrid systems. The results also provide theoretical foundations for the simulation technologies for such systems, including the time-marching strategy, evaluation of feedback loops, and the necessity of supporting rollback.},

  abstract = {Several mass-spring-damper models have been developed to study the response of the human body to the collision with the ground during hopping, trotting, or running. The mass, spring, and damper elements represent the masses, stiffness properties, and damping properties of hard and soft tissues. The masses that models are composed of are connected to each other via springs and dampers. This paper reviews the various types of mass-spring-damper models including 1-body and multi-body models. The models are further categorized as being either passive or active. In passive models, the mechanical properties (stiffness and damping) of soft tissues remain constant regardless of the type of the footwear, ground stiffness, etc. In active models, the mechanical properties adapt to external loads. The governing equations of motions of all models as well as their parameters are presented. The specific ways that the models use to take account of the shoe-ground interactions are discussed as well. The methods used for determination of different modeling parameters are briefly surveyed. The advantages and disadvantages of the different types of mass-spring-damper models are also discussed. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of the possible future research trends in the area of mass-spring-damper modeling.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a comprehensive and systematic framework for building mixed continuous/discrete, i.e., hybrid physical system models. Hybrid models are a natural representation for embedded systems (physical systems with digital controllers) and for complex physical systems whose behavior is simplified by introducing discrete transitions to replace fast, often nonlinear dynamics. In this paper we focus on two classes of abstraction mechanisms, viz., time scale and parameter abstractions, discuss their impact on building hybrid models, and then derive the transition semantics required to ensure that the derived models are consistent with physical system principles. The transition semantics are incorporated into a formal model representation language, which is used to derive a computational architecture for hybrid systems based on hybrid automata. This architecture forms the basis for a variety of hybrid simulation, analysis, and verification algorithms. A complex example of a colliding rod system demonstrates the application of our modeling framework. The divergence of time and behavior analysis principles are applied to ensure that physical principles are not violated in the definition of the discrete transition model. The overall goal is to use this framework as a basis for developing systematic compositional modeling and analysis schemes for hybrid modeling of physical systems. Preliminary attempts in this area are discussed, with thoughts on how to develop this into a more general methodology.},

  abstract = {The model driven engineering approach has had an important impact on the methods used for the conception of systems. However, some important difficult points remain in this domain. In this paper, we focus on problems related to the heterogeneity of the computation models (and therefore of the modeling techniques) used for the different aspects of a system and to the validation and the execution of a model. We present here a language for describing computation models, coupled with a generic execution platform where different computation models as well as their composition can be interpreted. Our goal is to be able to describe precisely the semantics of the computation models underlying domain specific languages, and to allow the interpretation of these models within our platform. This provides for a non ambiguous definition of the behavior of heterogeneous models of a system, which is essential for validation, simulation and code generation},

This paper provides a brief tutorial on model checking of C programs. The essential approach is to model the semantics of C programs in the form of finite state systems by using suitable abstractions. The use of abstractions is key, both for modeling programs as finite state systems and for reducing the model sizes in order to manage verification complexity. We provide illustrative details of a verification platform called F-Soft, which provides a range of abstractions for modeling software, and uses customized SAT-based and BDD-based model checking techniques targeted for software.},

  abstract = {VHDL-AMS is a suitable language to describe mixed signal circuits. The nature of analog and digital simulation is different, so they work with two different simulation kernels. Synchronization between these two kernels (the analog solver and the digital kernel) is an important challenge in the mixed signal simulation subject. In this paper we introduce an algorithm for mixed signal simulation that works based on reducing the analog and digital simulation interaction. When the simulator switches to analog simulation, the analog solver initiates the analog parameters to start analog simulation. Resuming the analog simulation needs some additional steps; in this algorithm we eliminate unnecessary switchings between analog and digital simulation engines. We first explain our simulator, then we describe our new scheduling algorithm. The efficiency of the new synchronization algorithm is shown by examples. Simulation results show that the newly developed algorithm can speed up the simulation in comparison with the canonical algorithm.},

  abstract = {Hybrid systems modelers have become the corner stone of embedded system development, with Simulink a de facto standard and Modelica a new player. Such tools still raise a number of issues that, we believe, require more fundamental understanding. In this paper we propose using non standard analysis as a semantic domain for hybrid systems - non standard analysis is an extension of classical analysis in which infinitesimals (the $\epsilon$ and $\eta$ in the celebrated generic sentence $\forall\epsilon\exists\eta$... in college maths) can be manipulated as first class citizens. This allows us to provide a denotational semantics and a constructive semantics for hybrid systems, thus establishing simulation engines on a firm mathematical basis. In passing, we cleanly separate the job of the numerical analyst (solving differential equations) from that of the computer scientist (generating execution schemes).},

  abstract = {This article describes the implementation of the Building Controls Virtual Test Bed (BCVTB). The BCVTB is a software environment that allows connecting different simulation programs to exchange data during the time integration, and that allows conducting hardware in the loop simulation. The software architecture is a modular design based on Ptolemy II, a software environment for design and analysis of heterogeneous systems. Ptolemy II provides a graphical model building environment, synchronizes the exchanged data and visualizes the system evolution during run-time. The BCVTB provides additions to Ptolemy II that allow the run-time coupling of different simulation programs for data exchange, including EnergyPlus, MATLAB, Simulink and the Modelica modelling and simulation environment Dymola. The additions also allow executing system commands, such as a script that executes a Radiance simulation. In this article, the software architecture is presented and the mathematical model used to implement the co-simulation is discussed. The simulation program interface that the BCVTB provides is explained. The article concludes by presenting applications in which different state of the art simulation programs are linked for run-time data exchange. This link allows the use of the simulation program that is best suited for the particular problem to model building heat transfer, HVAC system dynamics and control algorithms, and to compute a solution to the coupled problem using co-simulation.},

Focus has been on the influence the network communication exerts on the overall behavior of the system. The second extension, a new communication framework, allows for a smooth transition from simulation to a real control system, by hiding all low-level communication details from the control software. This separates the concerns of the control software from distribution and inter-node communication issues, creating freedom in process allocation.},

Existing electric power simulation tools accurately model power systems of the past, which were controlled as large regional power pools without significant communication elements. However, as power systems increasingly turn to protection and control systems that make use of computer networks, these simulators are less and less capable of predicting the likely behavior of the resulting power grids. Similarly, the tools used to evaluate new communication protocols and systems have been developed without attention to the roles they might play in power scenarios. EPOCHS integrates multiple research and commercial off-the-shelf systems to bridge the gap.},

Our approach features a component model which unifies hardware and software component models with the concept of bridge component. Bridge components raise the level of abstraction for designing HW/SW interfaces. Their specifications are used to configure the co-simulators. Our approach has been applied to co-simulation of sensor system instances included in the TinyOS distribution. The case studies have demonstrated that our approach is readily applicable to real-world embedded systems and reduces co-simulation complexities.},

A better driving of the M\&amp;S life cycle requires the objectives, assumptions and constraints in disguise behind this relationship to be explicit. A sound systemic-based foundation is provided here to achieve this goal in a clear abstract form. To this end, we give a thorough development to the concept of experimental frames introduced by the DEVS framework, and we erect a specification hierarchy. An application to fire spreading is shown. This work points out several benefits: firstly, it becomes easier to capture and to manipulate some M\&amp;S fundamental and advanced concepts, and then to enhance our understanding about them. Secondly, a significant improvement is gained in the M\&amp;S process by systematically accompanying the specification of the system with the specification of the context. Lastly, the formal framework, with both system and context specification hierarchies, provides a methodological guide to the modeling process.},

  abstract = {The design of automotive systems requires the joint design of hardware, software and micro-mechanical components. In traditional design approaches the different parts are designed by separate groups and the integration of the overall system is made at the final stage. This scheme may induce extra delays and costs because of interfacing problems. The paper presents a new automotive system design approach that offers many advantages including efficient design flow and shorter time to market. The key idea of our approach is to allow for early validation of the overall system through co-simulation. The design starts with a high level specification of each part. In our approach, software is described in C, hardware is described in VHDL and mechanical parts are described in MATLAB. A C-VHDL-MATLAB co-simulation is then used for functional validation of the initial specification. During the design process, the hardware and software parts may be refined using specific techniques and tools. The refinement steps are also validated through co-simulation. In this approach we use two kinds of co-simulation: untimed co-simulation is used for functional validation and timed co-simulation for real time validation. The paper describes the design approach and its successful application to an example from the automotive industry},

  abstract = {Both simulated and experimental studies of an anti-lock braking system are undertaken. A nonlinear mathematical model of the anti-lock braking system is built and a simulation is performed. Two sliding-mode controllers, one using pulse width modulation, and the other switching control, are designed and tested. Comparisons of simulated and experimental results obtained using these two control methods are discussed. Simulated results were verified on a test stand. Emergency braking controlled by a standard commercial electric control unit is also performed on the dynamic test stand and compared with the results of the designed systems. The proposed mathematical ABS model's simulated results match experimental data well.},

  abstract = {A discrete-time control algorithm for robust vehicle traction, which includes antiskid braking and antispin acceleration, is presented. The algorithm is a nonlinear feedback scheme that can be designed via classical digital control theory. The algorithm is easy to tune and modify to incorporate higher-order dynamics, which may be necessary for a practical hardware setup. The robust controller provides stable and reliable performance under a variety of uncertainties involved in the vehicle/brake system that are difficult to measure. The effectiveness of this new scheme is demonstrated by experiments on antiskid braking.$<$$>$},

  abstract = {Detecting software architecture inconsistencies is a critical issue in software design. Software systems are described in terms of components, component behavior and interaction and mismatch detection is explored through techniques based on behavior analysis. Integration problems, however, are not only caused by behavioral mismatch: components make assumptions about their environment to guarantee functional and non-functional properties. If the actual deployment environment of each component does not satisfy its assumptions, component and system properties may not hold. In this work we propose to extend the idea of architectural mismatch to include the notion of assumption. We concentrate on a subset of possible assumptions and show how software architects can benefit from using them. We also present a discussion on how architecture description languages (ADLs) can be extended to include assumptions},

Feature models correspond to context-free grammars without recursion, which prevents the expression of multiple instances and references. We then show how domain-specific languages (DSLs) can serve as a middle ground between feature modeling and programming. They can be used in cases where feature models are too limited, while keeping the separation between problem space and solution space provided by feature models. We then categorize useful combinations between configuration with feature model and construction with DSLs and provide an integration of DSLs into the conceptual framework of PLE. Finally we show how use of a consistent, unified formalism for models, code, and configuration can yield important benefits for managing variability and trace ability. We illustrate the concepts with several examples from industrial case studies.},

These views are represented by three graphical languages, the most intricate of which is the language of statecharts, used to depict reactive behavior over time. In addition to the use of statecharts, the main novelty of STATEMATE is in the fact that it understands the entire descriptions perfectly, to the point of being able to analyze them for crucial dynamic properties, to carry out rigorous executions and simulations of the described system, and to create running code automatically. These features are invaluable when it comes to the quality and reliability of the final outcome},

  abstract = {The paper describes how mixed signal simulation has been performed using a simulation backplane. This work is based on the draft standard for a simulation backplane, published by the CAD framework initiative. The simulation backplane allows two or more circuit, logic or behavioural simulators to be coupled. A circuit is partitioned between the simulators, and changes in analogue and digital signals connecting the simulators may be passed through the backplane. Synchronisation of the various simulators is handled by the backplane, and the paper describes a new synchronisation algorithm that avoids backtracking and prevents deadlock. A version of SPICE has been integrated into the backplane, and true mixed signal simulation has been demonstrated. These results show that the simulation backplane is a viable technique for linking multiple simulators, but that the overheads caused by interprocess communications are significant.},

  abstract = {This paper focuses on commonalities and differences between the two mixed-signal hardware description languages, VHDL-AMS and Verilog-AMS, in the case of modeling heterogeneous or multidiscipline systems. The paper has two objectives. The first one is modeling the structure and the behavior of an airbag system using both the VHDL-AMS and the Verilog-AMS languages. Such a system encompasses several time abstractions (i.e., discrete-time and continuous-time), several disciplines, or energy domains (i.e., electrical, thermal, optical, mechanical, and chemical), and several continuous-time description formalisms (i.e., conservative-law and signal-flow descriptions). The second objective is to discuss the results of the proposed modeling process in terms of the descriptive capabilities of the VHDL-AMS and Verilog-AMS languages and of the generated simulation results. The tools used are the Advance-MS from Mentor Graphics for VHDL-AMS and the AMS Simulator from Cadence Design Systems for Verilog-AMS. This paper shows that both languages offer effective means to describe and simulate multidiscipline systems, though using different descriptive approaches. It also highlights current tool limitations, since full language definitions are not yet supported.},

  abstract = {Mathematical models when simulating the behavior of physical, chemical, and biological systems often include one or more ordinary differential equations (ODES). To study the system behavior predicted by a model, these equations are usually solved numerically. Although many of the current methods for solving ODES were developed around the turn of the century, the past 15 years or so has been a period of intensive research. The emphasis of this survey is on the methods and techniques used in software for solving ODES. ODES can be classified as stiff or nonstiff, and may be stiff for some parts of an interval and nonstiff for others. We discuss stiff equations, why they are difficult to solve, and methods and software for solving both nonstiff and stiff equations. We conclude this review by looking at techniques for dealing with special problems that may arise in some ODES, for example, discontinuities. Although important theoretical developments have also taken place, we report only those developments which have directly affected the software and provide a review of this research. We present the basic concepts involved but assume that the reader has some background in numerical computing, such as a first course in numerical methods.},

  title = {Dynamically Switching between Lazy and Aggressive Cancellation in a {{Time Warp}} Parallel Simulator},
  isbn = {VO  -},
  abstract = {The performance of a Time Warp parallel discrete event simulator (PDES) depends on the efficiency of the cancellation strategy employed to undo the effects of the erroneous computation. Two known cancellation strategies exist, namely aggressive cancellation and lazy cancellation. Under aggressive cancellation (AC), when a straggler arrives at a logical process (LP), it rolls back to an appropriate previous state and immediately sends out anti messages for all the messages that were processed prematurely. In contrast, under lazy cancellation (LC), the anti messages are delayed until forward processing demonstrates that the originally sent output messages were incorrect. The performance under LC deteriorates if the probability of the regenerated output messages being different from the originally sent messages, is high. AC, on the other hand, performs badly if the same messages are generated before and after a rollback most of the time. In general, it has proven to be difficult to determine a priori the favorable cancellation strategy. Thus, we propose that the performance of a Time Warp simulator is best optimized by having the simulation dynamically select the cancellation strategy to be used based on the behavior of the application being simulated. A simple approach to achieve this is based on a parameter called the hit/miss ratio. The results obtained using this adaptive approach are compared with the results obtained using only aggressive cancellation or lazy cancellation. These results show that for our application, digital system simulation, the adaptive technique works better than either cancellation strategy},

  abstract = {Synthesis of analog circuits is an emergent field, with efforts focused at the cell level. With the growing trend of mixed ASIC designs that contain significant portions of analog sections, compatible design methodologies in the analog domain are necessary to complement those in the digital domain. The synthesis process requires an associated verification process to ensure that the designs meet performance specifications at the onset. In this paper we present a behavioral simulation methodology for analog system design verification and design space exploration. The verification task integrates with analog system-level synthesis for an integrated synthesis-verification process that avoids expensive post synthesis simulation by invoking external simulators. Thus rapid redesign at the architectural level can be undertaken for design parameter variation and during optimization. The verification suite is composed of a repertoire of analysis modes that include time and frequency domain analysis, sensitivity analysis and distortion analysis. Besides verification of design specifications, these analysis modes are also used to generate metrics for comparison of various architectural choices that could realize a given set of specifications. The implementation is in the form of a behavioral simulator, ARCHSIM.$<$$>$},

  abstract = {Most of the existing packet-level simulation tools are designed to perform experiments modeling a small to medium scale networks. The main reason of this limitation is the amount of available computation power and memory in quasi mono-process simulation environment. To enable efficient packet-level simulation for large scale scenario, we introduce a new CPU-GPU co-simulation framework where synchronization and experiment design are performed on CPU and node's processes are executed in parallel on GPU according to the master/worker model [13]. The framework is developed using Compute-Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) and denoted as Cunetsim, CUDA network simulator. To study the performance gain when GPU is used, we also introduce the CPU-legacy version of Cunetsim optimized for multi-core architecture. In this work, we present Cunetsim architecture, design concept, and features. We evaluate the performance of Cunetsim (both versions) compared to Sinalgo and NS-3 using benchmark scenarios. Evaluation results show that Cunetsim execution time remains stable and that it achieves significantly lower computation time than CPU-based simulators for both static and mobile networks with no degradation in the accuracy of the results. We also study the impact of the hardware configuration on the performance gain and the simulation correctness. Cunetsim presents a proof of concept, demonstrating the feasibility of a fully GPU-based simulation rather than GPUoffloading or partial acceleration, through adequate architecture.},

Moreover, this synchronous interpretation allows it to be compiled into an efficient sequential program. The LUSTRE formalism is very similar to temporal logics. This allows the language to be used for both writing programs and expressing program properties, which results in an original program verification methodology},

Hence, we co-simulate in parallel, the SystemC processes on multiple CPUs, and the GPU kernels on the GPUs; exploit both the CPUs, and GPUs for faster simulation.

This paper is devoted to the issues of compositionality for modular code generation, in dataflow synchronous languages. As careless reuse of object code in new or evolving system designs fails to work, we first concentrate on what are the additional features needed to abstract programs for the purpose of code generation: we show that a central notion is that of scheduling specification as resulting from a causality analysis of the given program. Using this notion, we study separate compilation for synchronous programs. An entire section is devoted to the formal study of causality and scheduling specifications. Then we discuss the issue of distributed implementation using an asynchronous medium of communication. Our main results are that it is possible to characterize those synchronous programs which can be distributed on an asynchronous architecture without loosening semantic properties. Two new notions of endochrony and isochrony are introduced for this purpose. As a result, we derive a theory for synthesizing additional schedulers and protocols needed to guarantee the correctness of distributed code generation. Corresponding algorithms are implemented in the framework of the DC+ common format for synchronous languages, and the V4 release of the SIGNAL language.},

Existing languages mainly focus on mono-periodic systems, implementing multi-periodic systems with these languages is possible but inefficient. As a result, current practice usually consists in writing one program for each different rate and then letting a real-time operating system handle the multi-rate aspects. This can be a source of non-determinism as communications between processes of different rates are not precisely defined. We propose a new language, built upon synchronous data-flow languages, to handle multi-rate systems properly. It has strong formal semantics, which prevents non-deterministic communications, and relies on real-time primitives that enable efficient use of existing multi-periodic schedulers.},

  abstract = {Real-time simulators have been used as an aid to power system design for many years. Over time, scaled-down physical models and analog computer-based simulators have given way to real-time simulators based on digital technology. Another trend has been the need for shorter and shorter frame times for these digital real-time simulators. Modern power electronic systems use highfrequency Pulse-Width Modulated (PWM) controllers. Indications are that frame times of 2 $\mu$S are needed for PWM switching frequencies of 10 KHz. As frequencies increase further it is possible that frame times of less than 1 $\mu$S may be required.In order to achieve these very short frame times, the implementation of this type of simulator requires careful selection of the methods and technologies used. The first involves thorough analysis of the integration method chosen, to ensure that it provides the performance, stability and accuracy required.

  abstract = {Recently embedded systems are often modeled using Simulink\textregistered{} to simulate their behavior. In order to perform the simulation, the modeling tool has to process the model. An important processing step is to determine the execution order of the elements in a model. This execution order is based on a sorted list of all semantically relevant model elements. Therefore, before simulation, Simulink\textregistered{} removes all model elements that only have a syntactic implication. In Simulink, the virtual subsystems are composite elements with no semantic bearing. Thus, Simulink performs a flattening model transformation that eliminates virtual subsystems. The work presented in this paper provides a novel algorithm for flattening composite elements in hierarchical models. Moreover, an optimized algorithm is also presented for Simulink models. With the implementation of these algorithms the level of abstraction of the model transformation can be raised. In this manner, a reusable, platform independent solution can be achieved for flattening Simulink subsystems.},

  abstract = {Embedded systems are usually modeled to simulate their behavior. Nowadays, this modeling is often implemented in the Simulink environment, which offers strong support for modeling complex systems. Moreover, via modeling, various analyses can be applied to the systems at design time. An important analysis is of the data types assigned to signal variables. Such analysis enables identification of potential problems during model compilation and so prevent runtime surprises. To assist the system designer, Simulink supports which includes a step for automatic data type inferencing (e.g., based on designed signal value ranges and on the connection structure of design elements). In contrast to the Simulink implementation of the inferencing in a code base, which favors efficiency, the work presented here raises the level of abstraction by explicitly modeling the inferencing logic. This unlocks benefits such as the ability to (i) reason about the logic, (ii) implement different logic by advanced users, and (iii) experiment with different ordering of other logic in the model compilation.},

The main idea of our approach consists of computing for each program location an instantaneous statement (called a job) that has to be executed whenever the corresponding program location is active. Given the computed jobs, the overall execution scheme is highly flexible, very efficient, but nevertheless very simple: At each instant, it essentially consists of executing the set of active jobs according to their dynamic dependencies. Besides the required outputs, the execution of the jobs additionally yields the set of active threads for the next instant. As our translation directly follows the structure of the source code, the correctness of the translation can be easily checked by theorem provers. Furthermore, our translation scheme offers new potential for multi-processor execution, modular compilation, and multi-language code generation},

An important parameter of these simulations is the frame-time necessary to capture the dynamics of the system being simulated. Modern power electronic systems, using higher frequency pulse-width modulation (PWM) converter control, demand frame times that are significantly shorter than those found in most real-time simulators. Simulations have been developed for 6-pulse and 12-pulse, 3-phase voltage-sourced converters connected back to back and to ac systems at either end. The hardware-in-the-loop capabilities of the simulator have been tested by interfacing the simulation platform, installed on one computer, to simulated hardware on separate computers.},

This paper combines generalized functions (specifically the Dirac delta function), superdense time, modal models, and constructive semantics to get a rich, flexible, efficient, and rigorous approach to modeling such systems. It shows that many physical scenarios that have been problematic for modeling techniques manifest as nonconstructive models, and that constructive versions of some of the models properly reflect uncertainty in the behavior of the physical systems that plausibly arise from the principles of the underlying physics. This paper argues that these modeling difficulties are not reasonably solved by more detailed continuous models of the underlying physical phenomena. Such more detailed models simply shift the uncertainty to other aspects of the model. Since such detailed models come with a high computational cost, there is little justification in using them unless the goal of modeling is specifically to understand these more detailed physical processes. All models in this paper are implemented in the Ptolemy II modeling and simulation environment and made available online.},

For timed systems we propose a specification language that refers to time only through age functions which measure the length of the most recent time interval in which a given formula has been continuously true. We then consider hybrid systems, which are systems consisting of a non-trivial mixture of discrete and continuous components, such as a digital controller that controls a continuous environment. The proposed framework extends the temporal logic approach which has proven useful for the formal analysis of discrete systems such as reactive programs. The new framework consists of a semantic model for hybrid time, the notion of phase transition systems, which extends the formalism of discrete transition systems, an extended version of Statecharts for the specification of hybrid behaviors, and an extended version of temporal logic that enables reasoning about continuous change.},

  abstract = {Hybrid system modelers have become a corner stone of complex embedded system development. Embedded systems include not only control components and software, but also physical devices. In this area, Simulink is a de facto standard design framework, and Modelica a new player. However, such tools raise several issues related to the lack of reproducibility of simulations (sensitivity to simulation parameters and to the choice of a simulation engine). In this paper we propose using techniques from non-standard analysis to define a semantic domain for hybrid systems. Non-standard analysis is an extension of classical analysis in which infinitesimal (the $\epsilon$ and $\eta$ in the celebrated generic sentence $\forall$ $\epsilon$ $\exists$ $\eta$ \ldots{} of college maths) can be manipulated as first class citizens. This approach allows us to define both a denotational semantics, a constructive semantics, and a Kahn Process Network semantics for hybrid systems, thus establishing simulation engines on a sound but flexible mathematical foundation. These semantics offer a clear distinction between the concerns of the numerical analyst (solving differential equations) and those of the computer scientist (generating execution schemes). We also discuss a number of practical and fundamental issues in hybrid system modelers that give rise to non-reproducibility of results, non-determinism, and undesirable side effects. Of particular importance are cascaded mode changes (also called ``zero-crossings'' in the context of hybrid systems modelers).},

  abstract = {Development of mechatronic systems requires collaboration among experts from different design domains. In this paper the authors identify a set of challenges related to the design of mechatronic systems. The challenges are mostly related to integration of design and analysis tools, and automation of current design practices. Addressing these challenges enables the adoption of a concurrent development approach in which the synergetic effects that characterize mechatronic systems are taken into account during design. The main argument is that in order to deal with software development problems for complex mechatronic systems, there is a need to look at system design practices beyond concurrency, i.e., there is a need to consider the complex interdependencies among subsystems and the designers that develop them. A review on current methods and tools is carried out to identify possible solutions proposed in previous works. The purpose is not to make an extensive review, but to show that integration, from different points of view, is a major issue and that increasing the level of abstraction in the description of systems can help to overcome the integration challenges. An increased level of abstraction also forms a basis for addressing other issues in mechatronic product development, which are presented in this work. With that in mind, concepts for an integration framework are proposed. The goal of the framework is to support a multi-disciplinary design team to (almost) automatically generate and verify control software. Based on high-level architectural descriptions, the software generation and verification process can be supported by knowledge-based methods and tools. Other goals are to support communication among engineers, improve reliability of designs, increase reuse of design knowledge, and reduce development time and development costs.},

  abstract = {Applying a non-linear model reduction method to the tire suspension system of road vehicles enables an automatic transfer of complex offline simulation vehicle models to a mathematical model, which fits the real time simulation requirements. The basic assumption, that high frequent inner suspension dynamics are not relevant to handling manoeuvres, converts the differential algebraic equation system (DAE) of suspensions with kinematical closed loops into pure elasto-kinematical linkage equations. The equations of motions can be represented as an ordinary differential equation system (ODE) and considerable simulation time reductions are obtained for the off-line simulation and real time simulation is enabled. This so-called macro joint approach is an alternative modelling method to the well-known look-up table representation of suspension kinematics but it keeps the parameterisation of the original suspension model and is suitable to parameterised real time MBS models. With a second step the dynamics, caused by compliance in the suspension bushings, are reduced to their quasi-static behaviour. The consideration of these quasi-elasticity has nearly no influence on the necessary simulation time. This contribution shows the theoretical background and demonstrates the advantage of the macro joint model reduction approach on a typical vehicle example.},

During the braking phase, the frictional heat generated at the interface disc \textendash{} pads can lead to high temperatures. This phenomenon is even more important that the tangential stress as well as the relative sliding speeds in contact is important. The objective of this study is to analyze the thermal behavior of the full and ventilated brake discs of the vehicles using computing code ANSYS. The modeling of the temperature distribution in the disc brake is used to identify all the factors and the entering parameters concerned at the time of the braking operation such as the type of braking, the geometric design of the disc and the used material. The results obtained by the simulation are satisfactory compared with those of the specialized literature.},

These results are applicable to large-scale linear delay differential equations with constant delays, but also extensions to a class of nonlinear delay differential equations with time-varying delays are presented. The effectiveness of the results is evidenced by means of an illustrative example.},

The increasing need for accuracy has led to the development of highly complex models. However, in the presence of limited computational, accuracy, and storage capabilities, model reduction (system approximation) is often necessary. Approximation of Large-Scale Dynamical Systems provides a comprehensive picture of model reduction, combining system theory with numerical linear algebra and computational considerations. It addresses the issue of model reduction and the resulting trade-offs between accuracy and complexity. Special attention is given to numerical aspects, simulation questions, and practical applications.},

However, it is well known and admitted that most of the methods devoted to this goal are unsuitable if the physical behaviour of the systems cannot be made independent from the probabilistic behaviour, as is the case for dynamic process systems. To overcome this inefficiency, some alternative methods have recently appeared. But they are not very approachable and could be, for this reason, ignored by most of the practitioners. Among these methods, however, simulation methods should be confirmed. From this point of view, the authors propose a straightforward approach to this problem by using stochastic Petri nets on a simple and well-known dynamic system from the literature. In addition, for testing this approach, the authors have carried it out on a system with periodically tested components. The results obtained are compared to those already published, the limits of the method are underlined and its efficiency in solving this kind of problem is being examined.},

However, these methods require a large amount of computation cost. By using coloured Petri nets (CPN), the required amount of computation costs can be reduced, and the length of the test suites can be reduced by using the equivalent marking technique on CPN. In addition, these methods allow us to test interaction parameters of concurrent systems. We propose two CPN based test suite generation methods for conformance tests: the coloured Petri net tree (CPT) method and the coloured Petri net graph (CPG) method. An experimental test suite generator (TSG) based on CPT method is presented. To show the advantages of the CPT and CPG methods, the effects of test suite length reduction by equivalent markings are evaluated},

Modeling the control system by a time Petri net permits us to develop an analytical procedure for fault detection.

  abstract = {The goal of System Level Formal Verification (SLFV) is to show system correctness notwithstanding uncontrollable events (such as: faults, variation in system parameters, external inputs, etc). Hardware In the Loop Simulation (HILS) based SLFV attains such a goal by considering exhaustively all relevant simulation scenarios. We present a distributed multi-core algorithm for HILS-based SLFV. Our experimental results on the Fuel Control System example in the Simulink distribution show that by using 64 machines with an 8 core processor each we can complete the SLFV activity in about 27 hours whereas a sequential approach would require more than 200 days. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that a distributed multi-core algorithm for HILS-based SLFV is presented.},

The block-diagram model of the control system is used to capture implementation effects such as sample rates and fixed-point data types. One implementation decision concerns the desired software partitioning used in performing simulation and program synthesis. This paper shows how software partitioning may yield undesirable side-effects involving 'false' algebraic loops, which affects model execution and program synthesis. It presents an approach to resolve these pathological cases for a class of block diagram models.},

  abstract = {Models in testing are important for describing, understanding, and managing tests. In the automotive domain, AUTOSAR is an important standard to model components of electronic control units. AUTOSAR, however, lacks information about tests or test scenarios. Early testing in the automotive domain is often done by Model-in-the-Loop simulation. Simulations of several components are run in different environments, each. Thus, they need to be connected (co-simulated) for integration testing of these components, e.g., via simulator coupling. This paper is focused on closing the gap between AUTOSAR models and co-simulation-based test scenarios that use simulator coupling. Our main contribution is the definition of a modeling language to describe test environments. The instances of this language can be derived from existing AUTOSAR models and can also be used to automatically generate co-simulation-based test environments. Furthermore, we provide a workflow to integrate this model in the engineering process and an experiment report to demonstrate the applicability and the advantages of the approach.},

  abstract = {Cyber-physical systems (CPS) involve communication networks, computation algorithms, control systems and physical systems. Many CPS, such as Smart Buildings, are subject to very expensive deployment costs and complex network interactions. Thus comprehensive modeling and simulation of such systems are crucial to ensure that they function as intended before deployment. Given the multi-domain nature of CPS, it is more appropriate to use a heterogeneous simulation environment to study system dynamics. In this paper, we design and implement an integrated modeling and co-simulation tool chain, called HybridSim, for the design and simulation of CPS. Firstly, HybridSim can transform and import existing system components from multi-domains into SysML, which enables systems engineers to design CPS with only these imported SysML blocks. Secondly, HybridSim can generate Functional Mock-up Units (FMUs) and configuration scripts directly from SysML designs. Finally, HybridSim can co-simulate these FMUs according to the Functional Mock-up Interface standard to synchronize their corresponding simulators and exchange information between them. We demonstrate the convenience and efficiency of HybridSim using a comprehensive hydronic heating system model for Smart Buildings as the case study to investigate the impact of packet loss and sampling rate introduced by the communication network.},

Based on this methodology the developed system is made as a virtual prototype and can be tested and simulated using co-simulation technique. The ADAMS and SIMULINK co-simulation is used and it is based on direct embedding of dynamic model of the mechanical system with sensors and actuators implemented in ADAMS into MATLAB environment to a control system design and a virtual prototype model tuning. So the complex model of mechatronic system applies the same implementation for design, simulation and testing.},

  abstract = {The development of embedded systems nowadays is strongly supported by simulation in order to reduce development time and improve product quality. However, effects occurring e.g. on the physical level may impact the whole system and cannot be captured by using only high abstracted models. Co-simulation is a possible solution for this problem. It enables the combination of an abstracted, system level view with highly accurate models of different components, and thus supports the analysis and validation of the embedded system. In this work we present an approach based on the inter-language run-time switching of simulation models during co-simulation. This new method enables long-time system level simulation with dynamic (user defined) switches to more accurate models for the punctual analysis of low level effects. The approach is applied for the co-simulation of an automotive distributed network and enables the analysis of the system at application level with a dynamically selectable accuracy down to the signal integrity within the physical cables.},

Most of the current issues are related to raising abstraction levels of HW/SW cosimulation. Mixed-level cosimulation is explained in a unified manner using a concept of `HW/SW interface'. First, abstraction levels in HW/SW cosimulation are explained in terms of abstraction levels of function, SW interface and HW interface. Transaction level models are introduced for HW interface. OS and device driver levels are explained for the SW interface. Then, the concept, applications and techniques of mixed-level cosimulation are presented. To better understand mixed-level cosimulation through SoC design flow, a view called refinement space is presented. Using the refinement space, cases of mixed-level cosimulation are explained in a SoC design scenario. Then, the issue of cosimulation performance in raising abstraction levels, i.e. Amdahl\&apos;s law in HW/SW cosimulation, is addressed. A new challenge of cosimulation for MPSoC is also introduced.},

This approach provides different combinations of power and performance models, and the switching of model accuracy during simulation, allowing the designer to trade off between simulation accuracy and speed at runtime. This is particularly useful during the exploration phase of a design, when the designer changes the features or the parameters of the design, trying to satisfy its constraints. Usually, only limited portions of a system are affected by a single parameter change, and therefore, it is possible to fast-simulate uninteresting sections of the application. In particular, we show how to extend the TLM and modify the SystemC kernel to support multi-accuracy features. The proposed methodology has been tested on several benchmarks, among which is an MPEG4 encoder, showing that simulation speed can be increased of one order of magnitude. On the same benchmarks, we also show how it is possible to choose the optimal performance simulation accuracy for a given power model, maximizing simulation speed for the desired accuracy.},

However, it places a burden on the designer to develop several communication routines, at different levels of abstraction, for each communication operation. This often requires an intimate understanding of both the simulator and the design being simulated. We present and demonstrate a way to use communication transaction annotations to provide a platform independent language for describing fast communication primitives. Additionally we show a tool for automatically generating some of these annotations, so that the designer does not even require an intimate understanding of the design under simulation. This can be important when simulating systems where the design itself is synthesized by automatic tools, and is liable to change frequently},

  abstract = {This article deals with the collision of steel bars with external surfaces. The central issue of the article is the investigation of the fundamental concepts that are used to solve collision problems by using rigid-body theory. We particularly focus on low-velocity impacts of relatively rigid steel bars to test the applicability of these concepts. An experimental analysis was conducted to study the rebound velocities of freely dropped bars on a large external surface. A high-speed video system was used to capture the kinematic data. The number of contacts and the contact time were determined by using an electrical circuit and an oscilloscope. Tests were performed by using six bar lengths and varying the pre-impact inclinations and the velocities of the bars. The experimental results were used to verify the applicability of Coulomb's law of friction and the invariance of the coefficient of restitution in the class of impacts considered in this study. Then, given the unusual variation the coefficient of restitution as a result of changing pre-impact inclinations, a theoretical model was developed to explain this variation. A discrete model of the bar was used to obtain the equations of motion during impact. Computed and experimental results were compared to establish the accuracy of numerical model. The internal vibrations of the bar and multi impacts between the bar and the surface were found to be two main factors that cause the variation of the coefficient of restitution. Furthermore, a slenderness factor was proposed to identify the subset of collision problems where the coefficient of restitution was invariant to the inclination angle.},

We motivate our approach by showing how the proposed synthesis technique simplifies to well-known results from supervisory control and pursuit evasion games when restricted to purely discrete and purely continuous systems respectively. We then illustrate the application of this technique to two examples, one hybrid (the steam boiler benchmark problem), and one primarily continuous (a flight vehicle management system with discrete flight modes).},

  abstract = {This paper describes a new algorithm for simulation of power electronic systems. Piecewise-linear (PWL) approximation is used to model nonlinear components, including switching devices, nonlinear reactive components, and nonlinear control circuitry. A representation of PWL elements is constructed such that a constant system matrix is obtained, regardless of the states of PWL elements. An efficient method for state determination is proposed, which is capable of resolving difficulties caused by discontinuous characteristics of PWL elements. The resulting simulation algorithm is quite general, requires no prior knowledge of the circuit operation, is void of convergence problems, and yields relatively short simulation times on desktop PC machines},

  abstract = {A novel method for representing Dirac impulses in switched networks is presented. This method can be applied in the analysis and simulation of switched networks when the ideal switch model is used. The Dirac impulses in the time domain are not approximated by large values which can give problems with conditioning and overflows. A logical representation of impulsive quantities is introduced. This representation did prove to be reliable and efficient in handling impulses which can be present at some of the switching transitions. Influence of impulses on the state of switches in the network can be easily accessed. No prior knowledge of circuit operation is needed to find the correct circuit topology after switching. The use of a state space description of the switched network allows one to predict the possibly impulsive transitions. Therefore, the impulse analysis can be performed only for a limited number of transitions},

  abstract = {An energetically consistent theory is presented for dynamics of partly elastic collisions between somewhat rough rigid bodies with friction that opposes slip. This theory is based on separately accounting for frictional and non-frictional sources of dissipation. Alternative theories derived from Newton's impact law or Poisson's impact hypothesis are shown to be valid only for central (collinear) or non-frictional collisions; generally the latter theories yield erroneous energy dissipation if small initial slip stops during collision between eccentric bodies. Collision processes are complex when small slip is stopped by friction; then either the direction of slip reverses or contact points roll without slip. An inconsistent theory based on Newton's impact law can yield erroneous energy increases when slip stops during collision; the consistent theory always dissipates energy. The impact law that specifies a simple proportionality between normal components of contact velocity for incidence and rebound is not applicable in any range of incident velocities with small slip if the collision is non-collinear with friction.},

  doi = {10.1109/BMAS.2000.888372},
  abstract = {Verilog-AMS is one of the major mixed-signal hardware description languages on today's market. In addition to the extended capabilities to model analog and digital behavior, the language supports a novel approach to merge existing digital and analog designs without rewriting the individual designs. At the center of this approach is the connect module and the connection rules. These language features enable the designer to declare modules, which can be automatically or manually inserted at an intersection of net segments with different disciplines. A mapping between different disciplines and therefore between the different domains, enhances the (re)usability of designs and enables a natural approach to mixed-signal design. Circuitry of interest can be modeled with high accuracy in the analog domain whereas less critical portions of the design are modeled in the faster but less accurate digital simulation domain. Since Verilog-AMS actively supports the mixed-signal approach, the interchange of digital and analog portions is straightforward and strongly encouraged. The purpose of this paper is to introduce the semantics of Verilog-AMS connect modules in greater detail and illustrate the impacts and tradeoffs on the simulation performance. Closely related principles of driver-receiver segregation, discipline resolution and cross domain communication are discussed and evaluated to provide a thorough description of the extended Verilog-AMS mixed-signal simulation capabilities},

SAMSON2 employs event driven simulation techniques to exploit the inherent temporal sparseness in VLSI circuits. At the circuit level, SAMSON2 can be more than an order of magnitude faster than a "standard" circuit simulator such as SPICE2 while providing comparable waveform accuracy. This performance is achieved by partitioning a circuit into subcircuits which are allowed to have separate integration step sizes reflecting their activity level. The accuracy of the solution is maintained by controlling the errors due to decoupling among the subnetworks as well as the local truncation within each subnetwork. Simulation examples of typical MOS integrated circuits (IC's) are presented. f},

Exact macromodels of a subnetwork are defined and a sufficient condition on the subnetwork equations for the existence of a macromodel is given. A multilevel Newton algorithm based on macromodels is presented. The algorithm is shown to have local quadratic convergence provided that suitable conditions on the continuity and nonsingularity of the Jacobian of the network equations are satisfied. The concept of latency for the analysis of large-scale networks in the time domain is discussed. The relationship between latency and numerical integration methods is investigated.},

In particular, it shows that the realization of model-based research of cyber-physical systems shall benefit from the convergence of such efforts using the functional mockup interface.},

  abstract = {Abstract This paper aims to investigate the impact of different Electric Vehicle (EV) penetration on quasi real-time Volt\textendash{}VAR Optimization (VVO) of smart distribution networks. Recent VVO solutions enable capturing data from Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) in quasi real-time to minimize distribution networks loss costs and perform Conservation Voltage Reduction (CVR) to save energy. The emergence of EVs throughout distribution feeder increases grid complexity and uncertainty levels that could affect AMI-based VVO objectives. Hence, this paper primarily introduces an AMI-based VVO engine, able to minimize grid loss and Volt\textendash{}VAR control assets operating costs while maximizing CVR benefit. It then presents a real-time co-simulation platform comprised of the VVO engine, grid model in a real-time simulator and monitoring platform, communicating with each other through DNP.3 protocol, to test the precision and performance of AMI-based VVO in presence of different EV penetration levels. Accordingly, 33-node distribution feeder is studied through different EV penetration scenarios. The results show significant changes in AMI-based VVO performance especially in CVR sub-part of VVO according to EV model and type. Thus, this study could lead near future VVO solutions to gain higher levels of accuracy and efficiency considering smart microgrid components such as EV in their models.},

  title = {Derivative-Free {{Parameter Optimization}} of {{Functional Mock}}-up {{Units}}},
  abstract = {Representing a physical system with a mathematical model requires knowledge not only about the physical laws governing the dynamics but also about the parameter values of the system. The parameters can sometimes be measured or calculated, however some of them are often difficult or impossible to obtain in these ways. Finding accurate parameter values is crucial for the accuracy of the mathematical model. Estimating the parameters using optimization algorithms which attempt to minimize the error between the response from the mathematical model and the physical system is a common approach for improving the accuracy of the model. Optimization algorithms usually requires information about the derivatives which may not always be available or not be appropriate for estimation which forces the use of derivative-free optimization algorithms. In this paper, we present an implementation of derivative-free optimization algorithms for parameter estimation in the JModelica.org platform. The implementation allows the underlying dynamic system to be represented as a Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU), thus enables parameter estimation of models designed in modeling tools following the standardized interface, the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI), such as Dymola.},

  abstract = {The functional mockup interface (FMI) is a tool independent standard to support model exchange and cosimulation, as intended by the automotive industry to unify the exchange of simulation models between suppliers and OEMs. The standard defines functional mockup units (FMU) as components which implement the FMI. The creation and exchange of simulation models with customers and suppliers across the automotive supply chain is highly beneficial: In order to support early phases of development (requirement formulation, creation of executable specifications, and rapid prototyping) the creation of FMUs for co-simulation is reasonable. In this paper, we propose a structured method for generation of FMUs for co-simulation which are versatile, highly transportable and fast simulating. We show how to compile FMUs based on SystemC and SystemCAMS, representing digital as well as analog and mixed signal electric and electronic systems. This tool-independent method allows inclusion of existing simulation models with only minimal adaptations. Additionally, no modifications of the standardized libraries are necessary with the outlined approach. The resulting FMUs allow convenient exchange and fast co-simulation of automotive systems, as they may be integrated by any FMI compatible master tool. An automotive battery system use case is shown to highlight these advantages and to demonstrate the simulation performance of the resulting FMUs.},

  abstract = {Checkpointing is widely used in robust fault-tolerant applications. We present an efficient incremental checkpointing mechanism. It requires to record only the state changes and not the complete state. After the creation of a checkpoint, state changes are logged incrementally as records in memory, with which an application can spontaneously roll back later. This incrementalism allows us to implement checkpointing with high performance. Only small constant time is required for checkpoint creation and state recording. Rollback requires linear time in the number of recorded state changes, which is bounded by the number of state variables times the number of checkpoints. We implement a Java source transformer that automatically converts an existing application into a behavior-preserving one with checkpointing functionality. This transformation is application-independent and application-transparent. A wide range of applications can benefit from this technique. Currently, it has been used for distributed discrete event simulation using the time warp technique},

  abstract = {The Discrete EVent system Specification (DEVS) formalism allows for highly modular, hierarchical modelling of timed, reactive systems. DEVS can be used to describe complex control structures for programmed graph transformation. A side-effect of this approach is the introduction of an explicit notion of time. In this paper we show how the explicit notion of time allows for the simulation-based design of reactive systems such as modern computer games. We use the well-known game of PacMan as an example and model its dynamics with programmed graph transformation based on DEVS. This also allows the modelling of player behaviour, incorporating data about human players' behaviour and reaction times. Thus, a model of both player and game is obtained which can be used to evaluate, through simulation, the playability of a game design. We propose a playability performance measure and vary parameters of the PacMan game. For each variant of the game thus obtained, simulation yields a value for the quality of the game. This allows us to choose an ``optimal'' (from a playability point of view) game con- figuration. The user model is subsequently replaced by a visual interface to a real player and the game model is executed using a real-time DEVS simulator.},

MOMENT (MOdel manageMENT) is a framework that is integrated in the Eclipse platform. MOMENT provides a collection of generic set-oriented operators to manipulate EMF models. In this paper, we present the model transformation mechanism that is embodied by the ModelGen operator. This operator uses the term rewriting system Maude as transformation engine and provides support for traceability. ModelGen has been defined in an algebraic specification so that we can use formal tools to reason about transformation features, such as termination and confluence. Furthermore, its application to EMF models shows that formal methods can be applied to industrial modeling tools in an efficient way. Finally, we indicate how the ModelGen operator provides support for the QVT Relations language in the MOMENT Framework.},

In this paper a uniform treatment of these two methods is illustrated by a tool called Visual Modeling and Transformation System. The concepts of an n-layer metamodeling environment is outlined with the related topological and attribute issues. Built on metamodeling techniques two alternatives for model transformation are elaborated, namely, the traversal and the graph-rewriting approaches. In our implementation all of the aforementioned mechanisms use metamodel as a common formalism, which can be considered as a uniform basis for storing, creating and transforming visual languages. The feasibility of the approach is illustrated by a transformation which generates C/C++ code from UML statecharts. \textcopyright{} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Petri nets are a promising tool for describing and studying information processing systems that are characterized as being concurrent, asynchronous, distributed, parallel, nondeterministic, and/or stochastic. The paper starts with a brief review of the history and the appli- cation areas considered in the literature. It then proceeds with introductory modeling examples, behavioral and structural prop- erties, three methods of analysis, subclasses of Petri nets and their analysis. In particular, one section is devoted to marked graphs- the concurrent system model most amenable to analysis. In addi- tion, the paper presents introductory discussions on stochastic nets with their application to performance modeling, and on high-level nets with their application to logic programming. Also included are recent results on reachability criteria. Suggestions are provided for further reading on many subject areas of Petri net},

Even though these notions have been in widespread use for quite a while, there is still little consensus about when exactly it is appropriate to use them. The aim of this article is to start establishing a consensus about generally acceptable terminology. Its main contributions are the distinction between two fundamentally different kinds of model roles, i.e. token model versus type model (The terms type and token have been introduced by C.S. Peirce, 18391914.), a formal notion of metaness, and the consideration of generalization as yet another basic relationship between models. In particular, the recognition of the fundamental difference between the above mentioned two kinds of model roles is crucial in order to enable communication among the model driven engineering community that is free of both unnoticed misunderstandings and unnecessary disagreement.},

In this paper, a single simulation platform, an electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulation program - PSCAD/EMTDC, was used to implement the detailed models of the components in a wide area synchrophasor network. Using the developed components models, a simple wide area damping control application was co-simulated to demonstrate the impact of communication latency, packet losses, and bit flip errors on the controller performance. It was shown that with the aid of co-simulations, application specific issues can be diagnosed and appropriate solutions can be investigated.},

It thus transforms a computer program that computes a mathematical function into a program that computes the function and its derivatives. Derivatives play an important role in a wide variety of scientific computing applications, including numerical optimization, solution of nonlinear equations, sensitivity analysis, and nonlinear inverse problems. We describe the forward and reverse modes of automatic differentiation and provide a survey of implementation strategies. We describe some of the challenges in the implementation of automatic differentiation tools, with a focus on tools based on source transformation.

  abstract = {The coupling of subsystems in a hierarchical modelling approach leads to different time constants in the dynamical simulation of technical systems. Multirate schemes exploit the different time scales by using different time steps for the subsystems. The stiffness of the system or at least of some subsystems in chemical reaction kinetics or network analysis, for example, forbids the use of explicit integration schemes. To cope with stiff problems, we introduce multirate schemes based on partitioned Runge\textemdash{}Kutta methods which avoid the coupling between active and latent components based on interpolating and extrapolating state variables. Order conditions and test results for such a lower order MPRK method are presented.},

  title = {Developing an Integrated Building Design Tool by Coupling Building Energy Simulation and Computational Fluid Dynamics Programs},
  abstract = {Building energy simulation (ES) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can play important roles in building design by providing essential information to help design energy-efficient, thermally comfortable and healthy buildings. However, separate applications of ES and CFD usually cannot give an accurate prediction of building thermal and airflow behaviors due to the partial modeling of the problem. An integration of ES and CFD can eliminate many of the assumptions used in ES and CFD because of the complementary nature of ES and CFD results. This thesis studies the fundamentals, implementation and application of ES and CFD coupling, significantly advancing the knowledge and experience in this area. The study has been focused on the iterative coupling of individual ES and CFD programs, which shows good potential of providing reasonable results with acceptable computing costs. The research first analyzes the principles and challenges of ES and CFD program coupling. To bridge three major discontinuities in time-scale, spatial resolution and computing speed between ES and CFD programs, special coupling strategies have been developed. Particularly, the staged coupling strategies proposed can effectively reduce computing time while preserving the accuracy and details of the computed results. The study discusses the solution characteristics of iterative coupling simulation. Through theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, the research verifies the solution existence and uniqueness of a coupled simulation. The investigation concludes that a converged and stable simulation can be achieved with four different data coupling methods. The study has further developed an improved iteration and control algorithm for the coupled simulation. An integrated program, E+MIT-CFD, has been developed by coupling a new- generation ES program (E+) with a newly-developed ready-to-plug-in CFD solver (MIT- CFD). All the coupling methods and strategies proposed have been implemented in this program. The program has been well validated with various experimental facilities. The comparison of numerical solutions with experimental data reveals the advantages of the integrated simulation over the separate ES and CFD applications. The study further demonstrates the performance and capabilities of the coupled program through practical design projects. Finally, sensitivity analysis of the coupling simulation to building characteristics and coupling strategies has been performed, based on which general guidelines are established for appropriate usage of the coupling simulation.},

First, a general and efficient model description for simulation is defined using XML. Each model is described with an XML file and stored in model database. A complete model can then be assembled based on these model descriptions. Simulation of a model is started simply by sending the model description to a simulation server and running it through a web-based graphics user interface. Second, a new gluing algorithm, denoted as the T-T method, is developed, which enables distributed simulations (both the component models and simulation of the components) to be coupled while maintaining the independence of the separate component simulations. Third, a logical distributed simulation architecture is laid out that can be implemented with one of the existing technologies for distributed computing. Interfaces between different network components have been standardized to enable extensibility of the architecture. These concepts have been incorporated into a prototype web-based distributed simulation system that demonstrates the potential of the new techniques for solving real engineering design problems.},

  abstract = {A new approach based on sliding control is presented for modeling and simulation of thermo-fluid systems described by differential-algebraic equations (DAEs). The dynamics of thermo-fluid systems are often complicated by momentum interactions that occur on a time scale that is orders of magnitude faster than the time scale of interest. To address this problem the momentum equation is often modeled using algebraic steady state approximations. This will, in general, result in a model described by nonlinear DAEs for which few control methods are currently applicable. In this paper, the modeling problem is addressed using an approach that systematically constructs an explicit state space approximation of the DAEs. The state space model can in turn be used with existing control methods. This procedure, known as realization, is achieved by solving an associated nonlinear control problem by combining boundary layer sliding control with the singular perturbation method. The necessary criteria for key properties such as convergence, stability, and controllability are established. Further, the new approach is illustrated using a vapor compression cycle example. This demonstrates significant advantages over directly modeling momentum interactions. [S0022-0434(00)00904-7]},

An example of such a relation is the energy relation in conservative systems or the analytical relation generated by an outer holonomic or non-holonomic constraint provided the Lagrange equations of the first kind are used. It is shown that, in general, the computed numerical values of the solution satisfy such analytic relations with poor accuracy. The aim of the paper is to show how the analytical relations can be satisfied in a stabilized manner in order to improve the numerical accuracy of the solution of the differential equations. The proposed method leads to a modified differential system which is often stable in the sense of Ljapunov, whereas the original system is unstable.},

We investigate explicit and implicit coupling schemes with different approximation orders and discuss three decomposition techniques, namely, force/force-, force/displacement-, and displacement/displacement-decomposition. Here, we only consider cosimulation methods where the coupling is realized by applied forces/torques, i.e., the case that the coupling between the subsystems is described by constitutive laws. Solver coupling with algebraic constraint equations is not investigated. For the stability analysis, a test model has to be defined. Following the stability definition for numerical time integration schemes (Dahlquist's stability theory), a linear test model is used. The cosimulation test model applied here is a two-mass oscillator, which may be interpreted as two Dahlquist equations coupled by a linear spring/damper system. Discretizing the test model with a cosimulation method, recurrence equations can be derived, which describe the time discrete cosimulation solution. The stability of the recurrence equations system represents the numerical stability of the cosimulation approach and can easily be determined by an eigenvalue analysis.},

(J Comput Nonlinear Dyn, 2014. doi: 10.1115/1.4028503 ). Here, we present implicit (semi-implicit) co-simulation methods with improved stability properties. Enhanced stability behavior can be achieved by extending the coupling conditions, i.e., by taking into account derivatives and integrals of the constitutive equations. The stability of the presented co-simulation methods is analyzed by means of a co-simulation test model, which represents two coupled Dahlquist equations. By discretizing the test model with a co-simulation approach, a linear recurrence equation system is obtained, the stability of which defines the numerical stability of the underlying co-simulation method. Results are presented for the three possible decomposition approaches, namely for force/force, force/displacement and displacement/displacement decomposition. Here, co-simulation methods are derived for coupling two mechanical systems. The presented methods may, however, also be applied to couple arbitrary non-mechanical systems.},

To stabilize and speed up the solution process, semi-implicit coupling approaches can be applied successfully. In literature, semi-implicit coupling approaches have been introduced, where Jacobian information is exchanged between the subsystems using partial derivatives with respect to the state vectors of the subsystems. The drawback of these methods is that the numerical calculation of the Jacobians with respect to the whole state vector of the subsystems is very time-consuming. The key idea of the semi-implicit coupling technique presented here is to reduce the computational effort by using Jacobian information only with respect to the coupling variables.},

This paper describes a methodology to co-simulate, with high fidelity and in one computational framework, all of the main vehicle subsystems for improved engineering design. The approach leverages the capabilities of three software packages (ADAMS, PSAT, FTire) to simulate vehicle kinematics/dynamics, powertrain dynamics, and tyre-terrain contact in one unified environment. As a result, information about forces in vehicle components, driver comfort, maximum cornering speed, fuel efficiency and engine emission details can all be obtained at the same time. This data is relevant when used for comparing competing designs that draw on different values of vehicle parameters (inertia, material, suspension properties, stiffness), powertrain system settings for conventional, hybrid, or fuel cell topologies, and tyre-terrain interface parameters (road profile, tyre pressure, tread). A generic sedan and US army?s high mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicle (HMMWV), both with conventional powertrain systems, are used to demonstrate the proposed simulation framework.},

Using a cosimulation technique, a multi-body-based full-vehicle dynamic model interacting with the EPS control algorithm is concurrently simulated on a single-bump road condition. The effects of EPS on the vehicle dynamic behaviour and handling responses resulting from steer and road input are analysed and compared with proving ground experimental data. The comparisons show reasonable agreement on tie rod load, rack displacement, steering wheel torque and tyre centre acceleration. This cosimulation capability may be useful for EPS performance evaluation and calibration, as well as for vehicle handling performance integration.},

The design and analysis of these systems using proper computational procedures allows capturing all the relevant features of their dynamic behavior. This work proposes an approach to the dynamics of the energy collection system based on the finite elements method, for the catenary, and on multibody dynamics methods, for the pantograph, integrated via a co-simulation procedure. A contact model based on a penalty formulation is selected to represent the pantograph-catenary interaction. The methodology is applied to the study of high speed train operations with multiple pantographs, as this environment constitutes one of the limiting scenarios for the increase of the operation speed.},

  abstract = {Virtual engineering becomes more and more relevant for different industries to reduce development efforts in terms of costs and time. Especially for large dynamical systems co-simulation is a promising approach for performing system simulations, where subsystems are modeled as well as simulated via tailored simulation tools in a distributed manner. In contrast to general purpose simulation tools for co-simulations an additional higher-level numerical solver (Master Algorithm) is mandatory, which has to be configured by the user and leads to significant additional application efforts: therefore benefits of modular development are strongly limited. Within this paper the occurring coupling challenge for non-iterative co-simulation is investigated and recently proposed solutions are reviewed. On this basis, the necessary information for configuration is identified and an approach for fully automated configuration of non-iterative co-simulations is derived. The proposed concepts are examined.},

It is demonstrated that these techniques significantly improve the speed of convergence of the waveform relaxation iterations resulting from application of various modes of block Gauss-Jacobi and block Gauss-Seidel methods to differential systems. Numerical results are presented for linear systems resulting from semi-discretization of the heat equation in one and two space variables. It turns out that overlapping is very effective for the system corresponding to the one-dimensional heat equation and preconditioning is very effective for the system corresponding to the two-dimensional case.},

  abstract = {Quadcopter control is a fundamentally difficult and interesting problem. With six de- grees of freedom (three translational and three rotational) and only four independent inputs (rotor speeds), quadcopters are severely underactuated. In order to achieve six degrees of freedom, rotational and translational motion are coupled. The resulting dynamics are highly nonlinear, especially after accounting for the complicated aerodynamic effects. Finally, unlike ground vehicles, helicopters have very little friction to prevent their motion, so they must pro- vide their own damping in order to stop moving and remain stable. Together, these factors create a very interesting control problem. We will present a very simplified model of quad- copter dynamics and design controllers for our dynamics to follow a designated trajectory.We will then test our controllers with a numerical simulation of a quadcopter in flight},

Additionally, we present a comparison between our approximation scheme and earlier techniques, including the use of common quadratic Lyapunov functions and a method based on matrix liftings. Theoretical results and numerical investigations show that our approach yields tighter approximations.},

Moreover, networks provide an idealplatform to employ heterogeneous hardware and software to solvemultibody dynamics problems. One fundamental difficulty with distributedsimulation is the requirement to couple and synchronize the distributedsimulations. This paper focuses on the algorithms necessary to coupletogether separately developed multibody dynamics modules so that theycan perform integrated system simulation. To identify a useful couplingstrategy, candidate numerical algorithms in the literature are reviewedbriefly \textendash{} namely, stiff time integration, local parameterization,waveform relaxation, stabilized constraint and perturbation. Anunobtrusive algorithm that may well serve this ‘gluing' role ispresented. Results from numerical experiments are presented and theperformance of the gluing algorithm is investigated.},

  abstract = {Subunits of coupled technical systems typically behave on differing time scales, which are often separated by several orders of magnitude. An ordinary integration scheme is limited by the fastest changing component, whereas so-called multirate methods employ an inherent step size for each subsystem to exploit these settings. However, the realization of the coupling terms is crucial for any convergence. Thus the approach to return to one-step methods within the multirate concept is promising. This paper introduces the multirate W-method for ordinary differential equations and gives a theoretical discussion in the context of partitioned Rosenbrock\textendash{}Wanner methods. Finally, the MATLAB implementation of an embedded scheme of order (3)2 is tested for a multirate version of Prothero\textendash{}Robinson's equation and the inverter-chain-benchmark.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we apply an input-output transformation passivation method developed in our previous work to an Adaptive Cruise Control system and analyze the system's performance. A co-simulation framework that makes use of an online optimization method called extremum-seeking is used to determine the passivation parameters. It is known that systems with input-output time-delays are not passive. Additionally, time-delays are unavoidable in automotive systems and commonly emerge in software implementations, communication units, as well as driver's behavior. We show that by using our passivation method, we can passivate a time-delay system and improve its overall performance by using an extremum-seeking co-simulation framework. To validate our work, we present simulation results in CarSim and Simulink.},

  doi = {10.1007/s00366-016-0476-8},
  abstract = {This paper addresses a co-simulation method for fluid power driven machinery equipment, i.e. oil hydraulic machinery. In these types of machinery, the fluid\textendash{}structure interaction affects the end-product performance to a large extent, hence an efficient co-simulation method is of high importance. The proposed method is based on a 1D system model representing the fluid components of the hydraulic machinery, within which structural 3D Finite Element (FE) models can be incorporated for detailed simulation of specific sub-models or complete structural assemblies. This means that the fluid system simulation will get a more accurate structural response, and that the structural simulation will get more correct fluid loads at every time step, compared to decoupled analysis. Global system parameters such as fluid flow, performance and efficiency can be evaluated from the 1D system model simulation results. From the 3D FE-models, it is possible to evaluate displacements, stresses and strains to be used in stress analysis, fatigue evaluation, acoustic analysis, etc. The method has been implemented using two well-known simulation tools for fluid power system simulations and FE-simulations, respectively, where the interface between the tools is realised by use of the Functional Mock-up Interface standard. A simple but relevant model is used to validate the method.},

  title = {A Co-Simulation Method as an Enabler for Jointly Analysis and Design of {{MAS}}-Based Electrical Power Protection and Communication},
  abstract = {Multi-agent system (MAS) protection is under investigation as a potential method for distributed control in modern electrical power systems. The coordination of the MAS is based on local measurements available to each agent's site as well as on the information exchanged between agents over the communication network. Hence, the communication network should be considered to be a main factor in determining overall system performance.Numerical simulation is a fundamental tool of the design process. Existing electric power simulation tools can satisfactorily model traditional power systems where power and communication are considered to be decoupled and MAS are not present. Similarly, the simulation tools for communication systems have been developed independently from the application, particularly power system scenarios, so they are decoupled from the actual use of the information. If the loop between communication and power is closed and the coupling is strong, as in MAS-controlled power systems, such a simulation environment may yield unrealistic results.Aiming at filling this gap, this paper proposes a co-simulation solution for power systems, communication networks, and MAS, based on the extended capability of the co-simulation platform called VPNET. VPNET consists of three parts: Virtual Test Bed for time domain simulation of power systems, OPNET for the simulation of communication networks, and the Co-simulation Coordinator for data exchange and time synchronization between the other two simulators. The Co-simulation Coordinator has been exploited for MAS integration, as the rules of each agent are defined in the modules provided by the Co-simulation Coordinator.The proposed extended co-simulation platform is tested in the analysis of the performance of the MAS-based protection schemes of a medium-voltage DC shipboard power system. Numerical simulations have been performed for communication testing and protection testing. In the communication test, the network parameters (bandwidth and transmission time) are analyzed to evaluate the performance of the communication network under various conditions; in particular, links failure. The MAS-based protection system was then tested under various operating conditions of the communication network (latency and links failure). From the simulation results it can be seen that the designed MAS protection can handle these conditions successfully. Particularly in the link failure conditions, this co-simulation platform could simulate the re-routing process of the communication network and lead to correct protection performance, which is impossible with individual simulators alone. These simulation results show the utility of VPNET in exploring the design trade-offs between protection strategies and communication in the design phase.},

  abstract = {Modern heterogeneous systems, due to their complexity and multifaceted nature, require flexible high-level design and simulation techniques that take into account both aspects of continuous time modeling and discrete event modeling. In this context, model-driven approaches and extensions of the OMG Unified Modeling Language for the Real-time Embedded system and System-on-Chip domains are gaining popularity, both in industry as well as in academy, since they offer a high degree of abstraction and provide a common framework for the design, simulation and configuration management. To establish advanced model-driven design environments for complex heterogeneous systems, possible strategies for combining such approaches and languages in a common modeling and simulation framework must be determined. This article proposes a model-driven continuous/discrete co-simulation framework based on the OMG SysML standard\textemdash{}a UML profile for system engineering applications\textemdash{}for discrete event modeling, and on the industry de-facto standard Matlab/Simulink for continuous time modeling. The proposed approach adopts a code-in-the-loop co-simulation schema where optimized C/C++ code\textemdash{}including glue code for time synchronization and model interaction\textemdash{}is automatically generated from Simulink and SysML models according to model-driven development principles. A supporting environment (also described here) provides simulation features such as remote graphical animation and model execution control.},

The possible speedups from parallelism are however often limited with the current centralized solver algorithms; which are commonly used in today\dbend{}s simulation environments. An alternative method investigated in this work utilizes distributed solver algorithms using the transmission line modeling (TLM) method. Creation of models using TLM elements to separate model components makes them very suitable for computation in parallel because larger models can be partitioned into smaller independent submodels. The computation time can also be decreased by using small numerical solver step sizes only on those few submodels that need this for numerical stability. This is especially relevant for large and demanding models. In this paper we present work in how to combine TLM and solver inlining techniques in the Modelica equation-based language; giving the potential for efficient distributed simulation of model components over several processors.},

  abstract = {Fundamental properties of hybrid automata, such as existence and uniqueness of executions, are studied. Particular attention is devoted to Zeno hybrid automata, which are hybrid automata that take infinitely many discrete transitions in finite time. It is shown that regularization techniques can be used to extend the Zeno executions of these automata to times beyond the Zeno time. Different types of regularization may, however, lead to different extensions. A water tank control problem and a bouncing ball system are used to illustrate the results.},

  abstract = {Cosimulation methods allow combination of simulation tools of physical systems running in parallel to act as a single simulation environment for a big system. As data is passed across subsystem boundaries instead of solving the system as one single equation system, it is not ensured that systemwide balances are fulfilled. If the exchanged data is a flow of a conserved quantity, approximation errors can accumulate and make simulation results inaccurate. The problem of approximation errors is typically addressed with extrapolation of exchanged data. Nevertheless balance errors occur as extrapolation is approximation. This problem can be handled with balance correction methods which compensate these errors by adding corrections for the balances to the signal in next coupling time step. This work aims at combining extrapolation of exchanged data and balance correction in a way that the exchanged signal not only remains smooth, meaning the existence of continuous derivatives, but even in a way reducing the derivatives, in order to avoid unphysical dynamics caused by the coupling. To this end, suitable switch and hat functions are constructed and applied to the problem.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present the co-simulation of a PID class power converter controller and an electrical circuit by means of the waveform relaxation technique. The simulation of the controller model is characterized by a fixed-time stepping scheme reflecting its digital implementation, whereas a circuit simulation usually employs an adaptive time stepping scheme in order to account for a wide range of time constants within the circuit model. In order to maintain the characteristic of both models as well as to facilitate model replacement, we treat them separately by means of input/output relations and propose an application of a waveform relaxation algorithm. Furthermore, the maximum and minimum number of iterations of the proposed algorithm are mathematically analyzed. The concept of controller/circuit coupling is illustrated by an example of the co-simulation of a PI power converter controller and a model of the main dipole circuit of the Large Hadron Collider.},

We show that the dribbling problem is closely related to robot juggling problems that are$\backslash$n well-studied. To this end, the paper introduces a hybrid (discretecontinuous) dynamical model for ball dribbling that provides$\backslash$n the basis for the design of reference trajectories and controllers. Furthermore the paper discusses local stability and parameter$\backslash$n sensitivity in particular in comparison to juggling. Theoretical results are experimentally validated for ball dribbling using$\backslash$n an industrial robot. Force/torque-based tracking and vision-based tracking are compared. For both tracking approaches, dribbling$\backslash$n for multiple cycles is achieved. The visionbased approach performs better as compared to the force/torque-based approach,$\backslash$n in particular for imprecise estimates of the coefficient of restitution.},

We sketch the different MBT variants that - according to our experience - are currently applied in practice, with special emphasis on the avionic, railway and automotive domains. The key factors for successful industrial-scale application of MBT are described, both from a scientific and a managerial point of view. With respect to the former view, we describe the techniques for automated test case, test data and test procedure generation for concurrent reactive real-time systems which are considered as the most important enablers for MBT in practice. With respect to the latter view, our experience with introducing MBT approaches in testing teams are sketched. Finally, the most challenging open scientific problems whose solutions are bound to improve the acceptance and effectiveness of MBT in industry are discussed.},

  abstract = {Advances in computation and communication are taking shape in the form of the Internet of Things, Machine-to-Machine technology, Industry 4.0, and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). The impact on engineering such systems is a new technical systems paradigm based on ensembles of collaborating embedded software systems. To successfully facilitate this paradigm, multiple needs can be identified along three axes: (i) online configuring an ensemble of systems, (ii) achieving a concerted function of collaborating systems, and (iii) providing the enabling infrastructure. This work focuses on the collaborative function dimension and presents a set of concrete examples of CPS challenges. The examples are illustrated based on a pick and place machine that solves a distributed version of the Towers of Hanoi puzzle. The system includes a physical environment, a wireless network, concurrent computing resources, and computational functionality such as, service arbitration, various forms of control, and processing of streaming video. The pick and place machine is of medium-size complexity. It is representative of issues occurring in industrial systems that are coming online. The entire study is provided at a computational model level, with the intent to contribute to the model-based research agenda in terms of design methods and implementation technologies necessary to make the next generation systems a reality.},

  abstract = {Integrated performance simulation of buildings and heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems can help in reducing energy consumption and increasing occupant comfort. However, no single building performance simulation (BPS) tool offers sufficient capabilities and flexibilities to analyze integrated building systems and to enable rapid prototyping of innovative building and system technologies. One way to alleviate this problem is to use co-simulation to integrate different BPS tools. Co-simulation approach represents a particular case of simulation scenario where at least two simulators solve coupled differential-algebraic systems of equations and exchange data that couples these equations during the time integration. This article analyzes how co-simulation influences consistency, stability and accuracy of the numerical approximation to the solution. Consistency and zero-stability are studied for a general class of the problem, while a detailed consistency and absolute stability analysis is given for a simple two-body problem. Since the accuracy of the numerical approximation to the solution is reduced in co-simulation, the article concludes by discussing ways for how to improve accuracy. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

It is generally known that composability and reusability are daunting challenges for both simulations and more broadly software design as a whole. We have conducted a small case study in order to clarify the role that model context plays in simulation composability and reusability. For a simple problem: compute the position and velocity of a falling body, we found that a reasonable formulation of a solution included a surprising number of implicit constraints. Equally surprising, in a challenge posed to a small group of capable individuals, no one of them was able to identify more than three-quarters of the ultimate set of validation constraints. We document the challenge, interpret its results, and discuss the utility our study will have in future investigations into simulation composition and reuse.},

Experimental frames have been applied in this context to formally define a system's context. During the creation of an experimental frame for a simple spring model it becomes clear that experimental frames in their current definition lack certain properties and omit relevant information. Our approach describes the process of capturing the context of models and systems to provide truly reproducible experiment descriptions. The information, captured as experimental setups, can then be used for different purposes and in different scenarios, in particular for checking the validity of a model, the discovery of suitable models for the design of a system, and for calibrating models.},

This paper proposes a Fuzzy Logic based Life-Extending Control (FLEC) system for increasing the service life of the ABS. FLEC achieves significant improvement in service life by the trade-off between satisfactory dynamic performance and safe operation. The proposed FLEC incorporates structural damage model of the ABS. The model utilizes the dynamic behavior of the ABS and predicts the wear rates of the brake pads/disc. Based on the predicted wear rates, the proposed fuzzy logic controller modifies its control strategy on-line to keep safe operation leading to increase in service time of the ABS. FLEC is fine tuned via genetic algorithm and its effectiveness is verified through simulations of emergency stops of a passenger vehicle model. \textcopyright{} 2013 Ain Shams University.

Its primary goal is concurrent execution of large, irregular discrete event simulations at maximum speed. It also supports any other distributed applications that are synchronized by virtual time.The Time Warp Operating System includes a complete implementation of the Time Warp mechanism, and is a substantial departure from conventional operating systems in that it performs synchronization by a general distributed process rollback mechanism. The use of general rollback forces a rethinking of many aspects of operating system design, including programming interface, scheduling, message routing and queueing, storage management, flow control, and commitment.In this paper we review the mechanics of Time Warp, describe the TWOS operating system, show how to construct simulations in object-oriented form to run under TWOS, and offer a qualitative comparison of Time Warp to the Chandy-Misra method of distributed simulation. We also include details of two benchmark simulations and preliminary measurements of time-to-completion, speedup, rollback rate, and antimessage rate, all as functions of the number of processors used.},

  abstract = {SIMNET was the first successful implementation of large-scale, real-time, man-in-the-loop simulator networking for team training and mission rehearsal in military operations. The paper provides some historical background on how SIMNET was developed within the US Department of Defense, and outlines the key philosophical and architectural principles on which it was based. The SIMNET battlefield simulation was sponsored by ARPA (then called DARPA), in partnership with the US Army, and was developed and implemented between 1983 and 1990. The emphasis of SIMNET from the outset was on enhancing tactical team performance by providing commanders and troops an opportunity to practice their skills in a dynamic, free-play environment, in which battle outcomes depend on team coordination and individual initiative, rather than on scripted scenarios controlled by an instructor. This program demonstrated the feasibility of linking together hundreds or thousands of simulators (representing tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, helicopters, fired-wing aircraft, etc.) to create a consistent, virtual world in which all participants experience a coherent, logical sequence of events. In this world, the causal connections among these tactical events, from the individual crew station to the battalion command post, are clear and easily inspectable. The SIMNET architecture and protocols have evolved into the Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) Standard Protocols (IEEE 1278-1993 and its successors), and have provided the foundation for a new generation of battlefield simulations for training, mission rehearsal, tactics development, evaluation of hypothetical new battlefield systems, and concept testing and evaluation. The authors are two of the principal architects of SIMNET: Thorpe was the original DARPA SIMNET program manager and Miller formed and led the group at Bolt Beranek and Newman, Inc. (BBN) that designed and implemented the SIMNET protocols and software},

  abstract = {Multi-disciplinary engineering (ME) projects are conducted in complex heterogeneous environments, where participants, originating from different disciplines, e.g., mechanical, electrical, and software engineering, collaborate to satisfy project and product quality as well as time constraints. Detecting defects across discipline boundaries early and efficiently in the engineering process is a challenging task due to heterogeneous data sources. In this paper we explore how Semantic Web technologies can address this challenge and present the Ontology-based Cross-Disciplinary Defect Detection (OCDD) approach that supports automated cross-disciplinary defect detection in ME environments, while allowing engineers to keep their well-known tools, data models, and their customary engineering workflows. We evaluate the approach in a case study at an industry partner, a large-scale industrial automation software provider, and report on our experiences and lessons learned. Major result was that the OCDD approach was found useful in the evaluation context and more efficient than manual defect detection, if cross-disciplinary defects had to be handled.},

  doi = {10.1115/1.4007986},
  abstract = {Mechatronic design is traditionally supported through domain-specific design activities throughout the product development process. The partitioning into domain-specific problems leads to a situation where product properties influence each other, hence giving rise to dependencies. These dependencies play a key role in the prediction of properties and, as a result, in the decision-making process. The important question is how to manage the dependencies for efficient and effective decision making? The aim of this paper is threefold. First, we investigate the nature of dependencies and study how to model them. The paper proposes appropriate terminology taking into account the synthesis and analysis nature of both the properties and the dependencies. This terminology will be the core of the new dependency modeling language. The concepts related to dependency modeling are then illustrated through a simple robot design example, where the creation and importance of a dependency model are explained. Second, we study practical approaches for consistency management and model management in the presence of dependencies. Six levels-of-detail in modeling dependencies are presented; emphasizing that modeling at a higher level-of-detail ensures that more inconsistencies are avoided. Available languages such as OMG SysML\texttrademark{} are evaluated for a possible creation of the dependency models leading toward executable dependency networks. However, at present, SysML does not provide sufficiently rich language constructs to model dependencies. Third, we compare our dependency modeling approach to other state-of-the-art approaches such as dependency modeling with a design structure matrix (DSM), and highlight the benefits of the terminology proposed in this paper. We aim to convince the reader that there is substantial value in modeling dependencies explicitly, especially to avoid inconsistencies, which is not the current state of practice. However, an overall value from dependency modeling can only be obtained if the cost of creating the dependency model is reasonable. Issues such as human interaction/effort and model management through product lifecycle management (PLM) are discussed.},

  abstract = {Modern systems integrate components specific to different application domains. Frequently, these systems combine continuous and discrete sub-systems and therefore their design involves overcoming specific global modeling and validation challenges. In order to generate global simulation models of heterogeneous systems the designers need efficient tools for systems' validation. Therefore, a new type of designers emerged, the designers of co-simulation tools. Their main objective is to provide coherent tools for the co-simulation models' designers. Given the diversity of abstractions, languages and simulation tools, the design of co-simulation tools may be costly and time consuming. Thus, the key for the improvement of the validation process is to define a model-based generic approach before the implementation of these tools. This requires new skills on formalism and formal verification domain. This paper proposes a generic conceptual framework based on formal representation of the co-simulation interfaces for co-simulation tools design. The framework can be used to provide rigorous global formal co-simulation models for continuous/discrete heterogeneous systems. It allows the definition for implementation of the co-simulation interfaces starting with their formal definitions that are gradually refined and verified. The global formal model also provides the rules for the implementation and the generation of the interfaces. The framework is the skeleton on which the designers can build accurate tools for global execution models of continuous/discrete heterogeneous systems. The approach was used to design a co-simulation tool that is presented in this paper.},

With their increase in complexity, co-simulation, which involves the coordinated use of heterogeneous models and tools, has become widespread. An industry standard, FMI, has been developed to support orchestration; we provide the first behavioural semantics of FMI. We use the state-rich process algebra, \$\$\{\{$\backslash$textsf \{$\backslash$textit\{Circus\}\}\}\}\$\$ , to present our modelling approach, and indicate how models can be automatically generated from a description of the individual simulations and their dependencies. We illustrate the work using three algorithms for orchestration. A stateless version of the models can be verified using model checking via translation to CSP. With that, we can prove important properties of these algorithms, like termination and determinism, for example. We also show that the example provided in the FMI standard is not a valid algorithm.},

  abstract = {Engineering complex Cyber-Physical Systems, such as emission reduction control systems for large two-stroke engines, require advanced modelling of both the cyber and physical aspects. Different tools are specialised for each of these domains and a combination of tools validating different properties is often desirable. However, it is non-trivial to be able to combine such different models of different constituent elements. In order to reduce the need for expensive tests on the real system it is advantageous to be able to combine such heterogeneous models in a joint co-simulation in order to reduce the overall costs of validation. This paper demonstrates how this can be achieved for a commercial system developed by MAN Diesel \& Turbo using a newly developed tool chain based on the Functional Mock-up Interface standard for co-simulation supporting different operating systems. The generality of the suggested approach also enables future scenarios incorporating constituent models supplied by sub-suppliers while protecting their Intellectual Property.},

Building upon this tool, we develop the first arbitrarily accurate approximation schemes for estimating the constrained joint spectral radius $\rho$\textasciicircum, that is the exponential growth rate of a switching system with constrained switching sequences. More precisely, given a relative accuracy r$<$0, the algorithms compute an estimate of $\rho$\textasciicircum{} within the range [$\rho$\textasciicircum,(1+r)$\rho$\textasciicircum{}]. These algorithms amount to solve a well defined convex optimization program with known time-complexity, and whose size depends on the desired relative accuracy r$<$0.},

This paper aims to briefly survey recent results in this field. First, the stability analysis for switched systems is reviewed. We focus on the stability analysis for switched linear systems under arbitrary switching, and we highlight necessary and sufficient conditions for asymptotic stability. After a brief review of the stability analysis under restricted switching and the multiple Lyapunov function theory, the switching stabilization problem is studied, and a variety of switching stabilization methods found in the literature are outlined. Then the switching stabilizability problem is investigated, that is under what condition it is possible to stabilize a switched system by properly designing switching control laws. Note that the switching stabilizability problem has been one of the most elusive problems in the switched systems literature. A necessary and sufficient condition for asymptotic stabilizability of switched linear systems is described here.},

For such problems, we need to seek both the optimal switching instants and the optimal continuous inputs. In order to search for the optimal switching instants, the derivatives of the optimal cost with respect to the switching instants need to be known. The most important contribution of the paper is a method which first transcribes an optimal control problem into an equivalent problem parameterized by the switching instants and then obtains the values of the derivatives based on the solution of a two point boundary value differential algebraic equation formed by the state, costate, stationarity equations, the boundary and continuity conditions, along with their differentiations. This method is applied to general switched linear quadratic problems and an efficient method based on the solution of an initial value ordinary differential equation is developed. An extension of the method is also applied to problems with internally forced switching. Examples are shown to illustrate the results in the paper.},

For matrix products whose multipliers are applied not arbitrarily but in accordance with some Markovian law, there are also known analogs of the joint and generalized spectral radii. However, the known proofs of the Berger-Wang formula hardly can be directly applied in the case of Markovian products of matrices since they essentially rely on the arbitrariness of appearance of different matrices in the related matrix products. Nevertheless, as has been shown by X. Dai [1] the Berger-Wang formula is valid for the case of Markovian analogs of the joint and the generalized spectral radii too, although the proof in this case heavily exploits the more involved techniques of multiplicative ergodic theory. In the paper we propose a matrix theory construction allowing to deduce the Markovian analog of the Berger-Wang formula from the classical Berger-Wang formula. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {The joint spectral radius (JSR) of a set of matrices characterizes the maximal asymptotic growth rate of an infinite product of matrices of the set. This quantity appears in a number of applications including the stability of switched and hybrid systems. A popular method used for the stability analysis of these systems searches for a Lyapunov function with convex optimization tools. We investigate dual formulations for this approach and leverage these dual programs for developing new analysis tools for the JSR. We show that the dual of this convex problem searches for the occupations measures of trajectories with high asymptotic growth rate. We both show how to generate a sequence of guaranteed high asymptotic growth rate and how to detect cases where we can provide lower bounds to the JSR. We deduce from it a new guarantee for the upper bound provided by the sum of squares lyapunov program. We end this paper with a method to reduce the computation of the JSR of low rank matrices to the computation of the constrained JSR of matrices of small dimension. All results of this paper are presented for the general case of constrained switched systems, that is, systems for which the switching signal is constrained by an automaton.},

The obtained results then facilitate the studies on the issue of asynchronous control, where ``asynchronous'' means the switching of the controllers has a lag to the switching of system modes. In light of the proposed Lyapunov-like functions, the desired mode-dependent controllers can be designed since the unmatched controllers are allowed to perform in the interval of asynchronous switching before the matched ones are applied. The problem of asynchronous control for the underlying systems in linear cases is then formulated. The conditions of the existence of admissible asynchronous controllers are derived, and a numerical example is provided to show the potential of the developed results.},

A simple model with steering and directyaw moment control inputs was constructed to calculate the TTR in real-time.The TruckSim dynamic simulation software was used to verify the control performance,as well as to simulate the system dynamics in the UM-Oakland driving simulator.Both the simple and complex (TruckSim) models were tuned to match the behaviorof a 1997 Jeep Cherokee vehicle with lateral acceleration up to 0.6 g. Theperformance of the proposed control system was compared with other threshold-basedrollover-prevention control algorithms. Finally, a human-in-the-loop experimentwas conducted to study the performance of the proposed algorithm under morerealistic driving conditions.

Current approaches for certification, fleet management and sustainment are largely based on statistical distributions of material properties, heuristic design philosophies, physical testing and assumed similitude between testing and operational conditions and will likely be unable to address these extreme requirements. To address the shortcomings of conventional approaches, a fundamental paradigm shift is needed. This paradigm shift, the Digital Twin, integrates ultra-high fidelity simulation with the vehicle's on-board integrated vehicle health management system, maintenance history and all available historical and fleet data to mirror the life of its flying twin and enable unprecedented levels of safety and reliability.

Filled with a wealth of examples to illustrate concepts, this book presents a complete theory of robust asymptotic stability for hybrid dynamical systems that is applicable to the design of hybrid control algorithms--algorithms that feature logic, timers, or combinations of digital and analog components. With the tools of modern mathematical analysis, Hybrid Dynamical Systems unifies and generalizes earlier developments in continuous-time and discrete-time nonlinear systems. It presents hybrid system versions of the necessary and sufficient Lyapunov conditions for asymptotic stability, invariance principles, and approximation techniques, and examines the robustness of asymptotic stability, motivated by the goal of designing robust hybrid control algorithms. This self-contained and classroom-tested book requires standard background in mathematical analysis and differential equations or nonlinear systems. It will interest graduate students in engineering as well as students and researchers in control, computer science, and mathematics.},

  abstract = {There are many communication imperfections in networked control systems (NCS) such as varying transmission delays, varying sampling/transmission intervals, packet loss, communication constraints and quantization effects. Most of the available literature on NCS focuses on only some of these aspects, while ignoring the others. In this paper we present a general framework that incorporates communication constraints, varying transmission intervals and varying delays. Based on a newly developed NCS model including all these network phenomena, we will provide an explicit construction of a continuum of Lyapunov functions. Based on this continuum of Lyapunov functions we will derive bounds on the maximally allowable transmission interval (MATI) and the maximally allowable delay (MAD) that guarantee stability of the NCS in the presence of communication constraints. The developed theory includes recently improved results for delay-free NCS as a special case. After considering stability, we also study semi-global practical stability (under weaker conditions) and performance of the NCS in terms of Lp gains from disturbance inputs to controlled outputs. The developed results lead to tradeoff curves between MATI, MAD and performance gains that depend on the used protocol. These tradeoff curves provide quantitative information that supports the network designer when selecting appropriate networks and protocols guaranteeing stability and a desirable level of performance, while being robust to specified variations in delays and transmission intervals. The complete design procedure will be illustrated using a benchmark example.},

The data matrix being Hankel structured is equivalent to the existence of a linear time-invariant system that fits the data and the rank constraint is related to a bound on the model complexity. In the special case of fitting by a static model, the data matrix and its low-rank approximation are unstructured. We outline applications in system theory (approximate realization, model reduction, output error, and errors-in-variables identification), signal processing (harmonic retrieval, sum-of-damped exponentials, and finite impulse response modeling), and computer algebra (approximate common divisor). Algorithms based on heuristics and local optimization methods are presented. Generalizations of the low-rank approximation problem result from different approximation criteria (e.g., weighted norm) and constraints on the data matrix (e.g., nonnegativity). Related problems are rank minimization and structured pseudospectra. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {In this paper a new time-stepping method for simulating systems of rigid bodies is given which incorporates Coulomb friction and inelastic impacts and shocks. Unlike other methods which take an instantaneous point of view, this method does not need to identify explicitly impulsive forces. Instead, the treatment is similar to that of J. J. Moreau and Monteiro-Marques, except that the numerical formulation used here ensures that there is no inter-penetration of rigid bodies, unlike their velocity-based formulation. Numerical results are given for the method presented here for a spinning rod impacting a table in two dimensions, and a system of four balls colliding on a table in a fully three-dimensional way. These numerical results also show the practicality of the method, and convergence of the method as the step size becomes small.},

Such mechanical systems contain a finite number of material points, whose motion is limited by unilateral constraints. The mathematical description of the problem, concerning the interaction between material points and unilateral constraints, is presented. The dynamic problem was defined in order to evaluate accelerations of elements and reactions of constraints. Moreover, the impact problem was formulated. The solution of the impact problem determines non-continuous change in velocities of elements and impulses of constraints' reactions.},

  title = {Early {{Insights}} on {{FMI}}-Based {{Co}}-{{Simulation}} of {{Aircraft Vehicle Systems}}},
  abstract = {Modelling and Simulation is extensively used for aircraft vehicle system development at Saab Aeronautics in Link\"oping, Sweden. There is an increased desire to simulate interacting sub-systems together in order to reveal, and get an understanding of, the present cross-coupling effects early on in the development cycle of aircraft vehicle systems. The co-simulation methods implemented at Saab require a significant amount of manual effort, resulting in scarcely updated simulation models, and challenges associated with simulation model scalability, etc. The Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) standard is identified as a possible enabler for efficient and standardized export and co-simulation of simulation models developed in a wide variety of tools. However, the ability to export industrially relevant models in a standardized way is merely the first step in simulating the targeted coupled sub-systems. Selecting a platform for efficient simulation of the system under investigation is the next step. Here, a strategy for adapting coupled Modelica models of aircraft vehicle systems to TLM-based simulation is presented. An industry-grade application example is developed, implementing this strategy, to be used for preliminary investigation and evaluation of a cosimulation framework supporting the Transmission Line element Method (TLM). This application example comprises a prototype of a small-scale aircraft vehicle systems simulator. Examples of aircraft vehicle systems are environmental control systems, fuel systems, and hydraulic systems. The tightly coupled models included in the application example are developed in Dymola, OpenModelica, and Matlab/Simulink. The application example is implemented in the commercial modelling tool Dymola to provide a reference for a TLM-based master simulation tool, supporting both FMI and TLM. The TLM-based master simulation tool TLMSimulator is investigated in terms of model import according to the FMI standard with respect to a specified set of industrial needs and requirements.},

  abstract = {It is challenging to assess the vulnerability of a cyber-physical power system to data attacks from an integral perspective. In order to support vulnerability assessment except analytic analysis, suitable platform for security tests needs to be developed. In this paper we analyze the cyber security of energy management system (EMS) against data attacks. First we extend our analytic framework that characterizes data attacks as optimization problems with the objectives specified as security metrics and constraints corresponding to the communication network properties. Second, we build a platform in the form of co-simulation - coupling the power system simulator DIgSILENT PowerFactory with communication network simulator OMNeT++, and Matlab for EMS applications (state estimation, optimal power flow). Then the framework is used to conduct attack simulations on the co-simulation based platform for a power grid test case. The results indicate how vulnerable of EMS to data attacks and how co-simulation can help assess vulnerability.},

  abstract = {NASAs discovery mission InSight (Interior Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport) scheduled for launch in 2018 will investigate the interior of Mars. For the subsurface locomotion, DLR's self-impelling nail nicknamed the "Mole" needs to hammer itself down to 5m into the martian soil with less than 5W of input power. A major focus during the Mole's development has been on simulation and analysis using virtual prototypes. As certain aspects of the environmental conditions on Mars cannot be recreated and tested on earth, high-?delity coupled simulations are required to achieve the accuracy needed. These co-simulations are composed by a multi-body based cross domain model for the hammering device and a discrete element model for the soil. The article focuses on the coupling strategy of both models as well solutions in terms of communication. Furthermore e?ciency improvements of the computationally expensive DEM models will be presented. Using these approaches the detailed stroke cycle and shock wave propagation are analyzed. Allowing to evaluate the performance under martian or terrestrial conditions.},

The analysis is performed on two formulations of the Einstein equations, namely, the standard ADM formulation and the conformal-traceless (CT) formulation. The eigenvalues of the amplification matrix are computed for flat space as well as for a highly nonlinear plane wave exact solution. We find that for the flat space initial data, the condition for stability is simply \$$\backslash$frac \{$\backslash$Delta t\}\{$\backslash$Delta z\} $\backslash$leq 1\$. However, a von Neumann analysis for highly nonlinear plane wave initial data shows that the standard ADM formulation is unconditionally unstable, while the conformal-traceless (CT) formulation is stable for \$0.25 $\backslash$leq $\backslash$frac \{$\backslash$Delta t\}\{$\backslash$Delta z\} $<$ 1\$.},

  title = {Energy {{Conservation}} and {{Coupling Error Reduction}} in {{Non}}-{{Iterative Co}}-{{Simulations}}},
  abstract = {When simulators are energetically coupled in a co-simulation, residual energies alter the total energy of the full coupled system. This distorts the system dynamics, lowers the quality of the results, and can lead to instability. By using power bonds to realize simulator coupling, the Energy-Conservation-based Co-Simulation method (ECCO) [Sadjina et al. 2016] exploits these concepts to define non-iterative global error estimation and adaptive step size control relying on coupling variable data alone. Following similar argumentation, the Nearly Energy Preserving Coupling Element (NEPCE) [Benedikt et al. 2013] uses corrections to the simulator inputs to approximately ensure energy conservation. Here, we discuss a modification to NEPCE for when direct feed-through is present in one of the coupled simulators. We further demonstrate how accuracy and efficiency in non-iterative co-simulations are substantially enhanced when combining NEPCE with ECCO's adaptive step size controller. A quarter car model with linear and nonlinear damping characteristics serves as a co-simulation benchmark, and we observe reductions of the coupling errors of up to 98\% utilizing the concepts discussed here.},

  title = {A {{Comparative Study}} of {{Interface Techniques}} for {{Transmission}} and {{Distribution Dynamic Co}}-{{Simulation}}},
  abstract = {Transmission and distribution dynamic co-simulation is a practical and effective approach to leverage existing simulation tools for transmission and distribution systems to simulate dynamic stability and performance of transmission and distribution systems in a systematic manner. Given that these tools are developed as stand-alone programs and there are inherent differences between them, interface techniques become critical to bridge them. Two important unsolved questions are: 1) which interface technique is better and should be used, and 2) how the modeling and simulation capabilities in these tools that are available and can be exploited for co-simulation should be considered when selecting an interface technique. To address these questions, this paper presents a comparative study for different interface techniques that can be employed for T and D dynamic co-simulation. The study provides insights into the pros and cons of each interface technique, and helps researchers make informed decisions on choosing the interface techniques.},

  abstract = {This chapter reviews techniques of model reduction of fluid dynamics systems. Fluid systems are known to be difficult to reduce efficiently due to several reasons. First of all, they exhibit strong nonlinearities \textemdash{} which are mainly related either to nonlinear convection terms and/or some geometric variability \textemdash{} that often cannot be treated by simple linearization. Additional difficulties arise when attempting model reduction of unsteady flows, especially when long-term transient behavior needs to be accurately predicted using reduced order models and more complex features, such as turbulence or multiphysics phenomena, have to be taken into consideration. We first discuss some general principles that apply to many parametric model order reduction problems, then we apply them on steady and unsteady viscous flows modelled by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. We address questions of inf-sup stability, certification through error estimation, computational issues and \textemdash{} in the unsteady case \textemdash{} long-time stability of the reduced model. Moreover, we provide an extensive list of literature references.},

An important issue for such analyses is to provide reaction forces during digging and loading that are sufficiently accurate to address questions of durability and energy efficiency. We present the coupling strategy, the coupled simulation approach as well as its realization that has been evolved during a project collaboration between the Fraunhofer ITWM and Volvo CE.},

  abstract = {This study introduces new time-stepping strategies with built-in global error estimators. The new methods propagate the defect along with the numerical solution much like solving for the correction or Zadunaisky's procedure; however, the proposed approach allows for overlapped internal computations and, therefore, represents a generalization of the classical numerical schemes for solving differential equations with global error estimation. The resulting algorithms can be effectively represented as general linear methods. We present a few explicit self-starting schemes akin to Runge-Kutta methods with global error estimation and illustrate the theoretical considerations on several examples.},
