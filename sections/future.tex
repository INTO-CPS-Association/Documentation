\section{Future Directions}\label{sec:future}

%\fbox{Peter Gorm Larsen}

It is envisaged that the INTO-CPS technology will be further extended as the FMI standard evolves and in particular in future research projects. Thus, the future directions here will depend both on the paying members of the INTO-CPS Association as well as which externally funded research projects that will be successful in achieving funding. In the subsections below candidate future directions are proposed.

\subsection{Adapting FMUs Easily to Ones Needs}

\subsection{Enlarging the tools and standards supported by the INTO-CPS Toolsuite}

\subsection{Use in a Cloud-based Eco-system/Marketplace}

\subsection{Use in a Digital Twin setting}

\subsection{Increased Support for Dynamic Evolution Scenarios}

\subsection{Incorporation of Computational Fluid Dynamics Co-simulations}

\subsection{Increased support for Human Interaction}

\subsection{Increased support for Network Considerations}

\subsection{Intelligence, Adaptivity and Autonomy}

\subsection{Tradeoff in Abstraction between Speed and Accuracy}
