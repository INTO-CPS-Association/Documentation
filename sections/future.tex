\section{Future Directions}\label{sec:future}

%\fbox{Peter Gorm Larsen}

It is envisaged that the INTO-CPS technology will be further extended as the FMI standard evolves and in particular in future research projects. 
Thus, the future directions here will depend both on the members of the INTO-CPS Association as well as which externally funded research projects that will be successful in achieving funding. 

In the subsections below candidate future directions are proposed.

\subsection{Adapting FMUs Easily to Ones Needs}

In the context of continuous system co-simulation, it is well known that there is no one-size-fits-all co-simulation approach. 
Different kinds of systems are best co-simulation different ways (cite survey).
At the same time, different domains have specialised numerical solvers, which means we cannot ignore the solvers in the FMUs.
A future research direction is to understand how to reconcile such contradicting requirements.
A possible way is to allow the user to preserve the exported FMUs, but change the way these interact with the environment, by wrapping an FMU around them \cite{Gomes&18a}.
This way does not solve all challenges in this regard, and the approach lacks validation from multiple domains. It is envisaged that this kind of Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) will be developed to make it easier to make semantic adaptations of FMUs.

\claudio{Maybe providing``connector'' FMUs for the most common connections in different domains. For example, if I'm building a co-simulation of an hydraulic system, I may want to connect a large pipe to a small pipe.}

\subsection{Enlarging the tools and standards supported by the INTO-CPS Tool Suite}

The INTO-CPS tool suite is on purpose open to any tool that live up to the requirements in the FMI version 2.0 standard for co-simulation. As indicated in Section~\ref{sec:toolchain} a possible entry point to the co-simulation setup is a special SysML profile supporting CPS models. Right now this is discussed in OMG as a potential new standard in a SysML setting and this is only supported by the Modelio tool (supporting export of both model descriptions as well as configurations of co-simulation). It would be great to see this special profile by other SysML tools as well. In addition, one can imagine that alternative tool supporting AADL \cite{AADL04} or Capella \cite{Roques17}.

There are also a lot of other standards for co-simulations \cite{Gomes&18} and it is possible to imagine that bridges from the INTO-CPS tool chain will be made to a number of these. Here the most obvious candidate is High Level Architecture (HLA) \cite{IEEE1516}. Initial work has been carried out in other research groups for such a combination \cite{Neema&14,Awais&17} but we imagine that more work is needed here to get this combination working smoothly.

%\claudio{Can you elaborate on this? What does supporting more tools mean? Also, which standards are we talking about? HLA?}

\subsection{Use in a Cloud-based Eco-system/Marketplace}

The INTO-CPS Application is made using Electron so it is using web technology but still requires local installation on the local computers. It is possible to imagine that it will be possible to move this to become a cloud application where it will no longer be necessary to install it locally. The DSE feature is already available in a cloud context as explained above. In a very long context it can also be imagined that the different modelling and simulation tools at some stage will become available on-line and possibly in a cloud context.

In addition to the tools becoming available in a cloud context one can imagine that it some point in the future will be possible to share constituent models in a cloud context. Such models could then either be available in a source form or a generated form in the form of an FMU. Optimally these could include both free as well as commercial models in a marketplace setting. We believe that this could enable a shortage of time required to develop multi-models for CPSs.

\subsection{Use in a Digital Twin setting}

In order to increase the value of multi-models one can imagine making use of them in a deployed setting, i.e., after the CPS has been deployed if data from it can be fed back to a cloud where a co-simulation can be used to predict how alternative interventions can be made and what the consequences of these will be \cite{Gamble&18}. This is known as a \emph{digital twin} but there are naturally a number of research challenges in connection with something like this since you need to determine how to set up such a co-simulation as well as what the consequences will be of the frequency of the data arriving in pseudo-real-time. For some types of application this could work, whereas for others the predictions would be far from representing reality. Research is needed to determine when this would work.

%\claudio{I can't understand what exactly this entails.
%Maybe it is best to describe the case studies that we want to support?
%To me, supporting digital twin entails at least enhancing the COE for real-time co-simulation (to use in a diagnosing use case)}

\subsection{Increased Support for Dynamic Evolution Scenarios}

\claudio{Not clear what dynamic evolution means\ldots Is this supporting incremental development (having multiple refinements of the same component?) Isn't this related to traceability?}

\subsection{Incorporation of Computational Fluid Dynamics Co-simulations}

\claudio{Might be easier to describe the use cases in concrete. For example, I think the into-cps can already support CFD co-simulations (you just need the FMUs to do that\ldots). What is does not support is error control techniques, that can kick in when CFD co-simulations are run.}

\subsection{Increased support for Human Interaction}

\claudio{Can you provide example advancements to support this? Example, real-time co-simulation seems an easy one. Maybe the ability to pause, inspect, and debug co-simulations?
Maybe fault injection?}

\subsection{Increased support for Network Considerations}

\claudio{What does this entail? Adding delays to the signals? Adding noise? Is this related to semantic adaptation or fault injection?}

\subsection{Intelligence, Adaptivity and Autonomy}

\claudio{We need to make this more concrete. Do we mean the co-simulation of adaptive systems?
Are we looking at variable structure systems? Or the development of a COE that is adaptive (nice challenge, to ensure stability with adaptive master algorithms)?
Also, another possible direction is to support certification processes by, e.g., having built in mechanisms to calculate the errors being made (during or after the co-simulation is run).
This is interesting because the user just has to provide the bounds he can tolerace, and the co-simulation will be run as many times as required, so that these tolerances are met.
Another possible direction is to support hybrid co-simulation (even when there is no possibility of rolling back from the FMUs).

\subsection{Tradeoff in Abstraction between Speed and Accuracy}

\claudio{
An interesting direction is to support DSE's, while using multiple abstraction models.
For example, higher abstraction models might be used to optimize the design globally, while lower abstraction models validate the candidate found, and further optimize each of them to find the best one.
